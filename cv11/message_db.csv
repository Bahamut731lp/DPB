1;2;2021-04-27 08:29:59.456208;Did you like Hawaii vacation?
1;1;2021-04-27 08:31:32.456208;I loved it.I want to live there.
1;2;2021-04-27 08:32:02.456208;What did you like?
1;3;2021-04-27 08:33:01.456208;The island is so green, and the water is so blue.
1;2;2021-04-27 08:34:42.456208;Did you go swimming?
1;1;2021-04-27 08:36:38.456208;I went to the beach every day.
1;1;2021-04-27 08:37:09.456208;How was the weather?
1;2;2021-04-27 08:38:45.456208;It was hot and sunny every day.
1;3;2021-04-27 08:39:49.456208;What did you do at night?
1;3;2021-04-27 08:40:33.456208;At night I went out to eat. The food was delicious.
1;3;2021-04-27 08:41:57.456208;What do you like about it?
1;2;2021-04-27 08:42:52.456208;We get a free breakfast.
1;2;2021-04-27 08:43:48.456208;Coffee and a roll?
1;1;2021-04-27 08:45:47.456208;No, a real breakfast.
1;3;2021-04-27 08:47:18.456208;Do they allow pets?
1;3;2021-04-27 08:49:00.456208;No pets, no smoking.
1;1;2021-04-27 08:49:42.456208;What's wrong with the bed?
1;2;2021-04-27 08:50:03.456208;Look at this sheet.
1;2;2021-04-27 08:52:00.456208;Yes?
1;1;2021-04-27 08:53:19.456208;See those stains?
1;3;2021-04-27 08:53:53.456208;Is this table okay?
1;2;2021-04-27 08:54:05.456208;No, it's too close to the kitchen door.
1;2;2021-04-27 08:55:26.456208;How about this table?
1;1;2021-04-27 08:55:55.456208;No, it's too close to the front door.
1;3;2021-04-27 08:57:33.456208;This looks like a nice table.
1;1;2021-04-27 08:58:34.456208;No, it's too close to the salad bar.
1;2;2021-04-27 08:59:38.456208;Okay, I give up.
1;3;2021-04-27 09:00:40.456208;Well, there is one good table.
1;1;2021-04-27 09:02:13.456208;Great. Which one?
1;3;2021-04-27 09:02:49.456208;That one. A group of eight just sat down at it.
1;1;2021-04-27 09:04:29.456208;Did you see "Titanic"?
1;2;2021-04-27 09:05:04.456208;Yes. It is a great movie.
1;2;2021-04-27 09:06:46.456208;I saw it twelve times.
1;1;2021-04-27 09:07:42.456208;I saw it eight times.
1;2;2021-04-27 09:09:07.456208;Turn the radio down, please.
1;2;2021-04-27 09:09:28.456208;But I'm listening to it.
1;2;2021-04-27 09:11:07.456208;Well, listen to it more quietly.
1;3;2021-04-27 09:12:16.456208;I can't wait till I grow up.
1;3;2021-04-27 09:13:53.456208;What will you do?
1;1;2021-04-27 09:15:22.456208;I will play the radio as loud as I want.
1;3;2021-04-27 09:15:32.456208;That's okay with me.
1;2;2021-04-27 09:16:57.456208;I will have a radio in every room of my house.
1;1;2021-04-27 09:18:21.456208;Remind me to never visit you.
1;3;2021-04-27 09:18:41.456208;All the radios will be on extra loud.
1;2;2021-04-27 09:19:41.456208;Your neighbors will hate you.
1;2;2021-04-27 09:20:50.456208;If they don't like it, they can move.
1;1;2021-04-27 09:22:37.456208;Can I try your coffee?
1;3;2021-04-27 09:23:53.456208;Sure. Here you go.
1;3;2021-04-27 09:25:42.456208;Hmm, that's not bad.
1;2;2021-04-27 09:27:35.456208;There's nothing in it.
1;3;2021-04-27 09:28:01.456208;What do you mean?
1;1;2021-04-27 09:28:50.456208;I mean, it's just coffee.
1;3;2021-04-27 09:30:31.456208;I figured that.
1;2;2021-04-27 09:31:33.456208;It's not too bitter for you?
1;3;2021-04-27 09:32:33.456208;It's a little bitter, but it's okay.
1;1;2021-04-27 09:33:35.456208;There's no sugar or cream in it.
1;1;2021-04-27 09:33:58.456208;No, it's a taste you have to get used to.
1;2;2021-04-27 09:34:30.456208;Sort of like beer.
1;3;2021-04-27 09:36:04.456208;I want sheets without stains on them.
1;3;2021-04-27 09:37:15.456208;From now on, let's bring our own sheets.
1;2;2021-04-27 09:38:21.456208;What time does your plane leave?
1;2;2021-04-27 09:40:10.456208;It leaves at 12:15.
1;1;2021-04-27 09:41:10.456208;When do you have to be at the airport?
1;2;2021-04-27 09:41:53.456208;I have to be there two hours early.
1;3;2021-04-27 09:43:49.456208;So we have to be at the airport at 10:15.
1;2;2021-04-27 09:45:45.456208;That means we have to leave the house at 9:15.
1;1;2021-04-27 09:46:05.456208;Well, it's an hour to get there, if there are no traffic problems.
1;3;2021-04-27 09:46:35.456208;So maybe we better leave at 8:15?
1;1;2021-04-27 09:48:30.456208;Yes, it's better to get there too early than too late.
1;3;2021-04-27 09:50:04.456208;I agree.
1;1;2021-04-27 09:51:45.456208;You never know what might happen on these freeways.
1;2;2021-04-27 09:52:30.456208;There's at least one huge accident every day.
1;1;2021-04-27 09:54:24.456208;I need to fly to New York.
1;2;2021-04-27 09:55:17.456208;When are you going?
1;2;2021-04-27 09:55:32.456208;During the Christmas holidays.
1;2;2021-04-27 09:56:38.456208;You'd better buy your ticket now.
1;2;2021-04-27 09:56:48.456208;You must be kidding.
1;3;2021-04-27 09:57:28.456208;No, I'm not. It's March. Time is running out. Seats are selling out right now.
1;3;2021-04-27 09:57:58.456208;I thought I would wait until October.
1;3;2021-04-27 09:58:42.456208;I'll bet this is the first time you've ever flown during Christmas.
1;3;2021-04-27 09:59:41.456208;Do you go to college?
1;1;2021-04-27 10:00:42.456208;Yes, I do.
1;1;2021-04-27 10:02:11.456208;What college do you go to?
1;3;2021-04-27 10:02:24.456208;I go to Pasadena City College.
1;2;2021-04-27 10:02:46.456208;Do you like it?
1;3;2021-04-27 10:03:35.456208;Oh, yes, I really like it.
1;2;2021-04-27 10:04:34.456208;Why do you like it?
1;3;2021-04-27 10:05:03.456208;Because it has great teachers.
1;1;2021-04-27 10:05:52.456208;What else?
1;2;2021-04-27 10:06:02.456208;I like all my classmates, too.
1;1;2021-04-27 10:07:10.456208;What do we need to buy?
1;3;2021-04-27 10:08:54.456208;Let me look at our list.
1;2;2021-04-27 10:10:33.456208;I know that we need milk.
1;1;2021-04-27 10:11:17.456208;Nonfat.
1;2;2021-04-27 10:11:56.456208;Of course. What else?
1;2;2021-04-27 10:12:36.456208;We need cheese, bread, and ham.
1;1;2021-04-27 10:12:54.456208;What kind of cheese?
1;1;2021-04-27 10:14:10.456208;Swiss.
1;1;2021-04-27 10:15:59.456208;Of course, the cheese with holes in it.
1;3;2021-04-27 10:17:52.456208;I never used to buy Swiss cheese.
1;2;2021-04-27 10:19:49.456208;Why not?
1;2;2021-04-27 10:21:03.456208;I didn't want to pay for the holes
1;1;2021-04-27 10:22:20.456208;Hi, Helen! How is it going?
1;2;2021-04-27 10:22:53.456208;Fine, thanks for asking and you?
1;2;2021-04-27 10:23:19.456208;Just fine. Where are you off to?
1;3;2021-04-27 10:24:55.456208;To the library. I've got a history exam next week
1;1;2021-04-27 10:26:20.456208;Oh, no. Well, I'll see you later then. Good luck!
1;1;2021-04-27 10:27:21.456208;Thanks. See you later.
1;3;2021-04-27 10:28:32.456208;I need some pants.
1;2;2021-04-27 10:29:10.456208;I thought you just bought a pair.
1;3;2021-04-27 10:30:15.456208;I did.
1;3;2021-04-27 10:31:16.456208;What's wrong with them so soon?
1;1;2021-04-27 10:32:59.456208;The pants are fine, but the pocket has a huge hole in it.
1;3;2021-04-27 10:33:22.456208;You shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket.
1;3;2021-04-27 10:34:21.456208;But that's what pockets are for.
1;3;2021-04-27 10:35:00.456208;You should carry them in a purse.
1;1;2021-04-27 10:36:36.456208;I'm a man, and men don't carry purses!
1;2;2021-04-27 10:36:46.456208;Well, you should buy pants with stronger pockets.
1;2;2021-04-27 10:37:01.456208;I would if I could find someone who makes strong pockets.
1;2;2021-04-27 10:37:35.456208;Try a Google search online.
1;3;2021-04-27 10:38:45.456208;I'm trying to stretch my dollars.
1;2;2021-04-27 10:40:23.456208;How are you doing that?
1;3;2021-04-27 10:42:07.456208;I started shopping at the dollar store.
1;3;2021-04-27 10:42:22.456208;That saves a lot of money.
1;3;2021-04-27 10:44:03.456208;I bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.
1;2;2021-04-27 10:45:46.456208;That's a good deal.
1;3;2021-04-27 10:47:18.456208;Yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes.
1;3;2021-04-27 10:47:34.456208;Just put them in the fridge.
1;2;2021-04-27 10:48:59.456208;Also, I bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee.
1;3;2021-04-27 10:49:34.456208;Why did you do that?
1;1;2021-04-27 10:50:26.456208;I mixed them together.
1;3;2021-04-27 10:52:01.456208;If the coffee still tastes okay, that's a good idea.
1;1;2021-04-27 10:53:59.456208;Let's go jogging.
1;3;2021-04-27 10:54:44.456208;That's a good idea.
1;1;2021-04-27 10:55:40.456208;I bought some new shoes.
1;2;2021-04-27 10:56:12.456208;Are they comfortable?
1;1;2021-04-27 10:57:44.456208;They're very comfortable.
1;2;2021-04-27 10:58:29.456208;How much were they?
1;3;2021-04-27 10:59:40.456208;They were on sale for $80.
1;2;2021-04-27 11:00:59.456208;Do they help you run faster?
1;2;2021-04-27 11:02:29.456208;No, but my feet don't hurt anymore.
1;1;2021-04-27 11:02:39.456208;Then they're worth every penny.
1;3;2021-04-27 11:03:25.456208;You might want to buy a pair.
1;2;2021-04-27 11:04:47.456208;I'll wait until I wear this pair out
1;1;2021-04-27 11:06:15.456208;Baseball is fun.
1;2;2021-04-27 11:07:32.456208;I like to hit the ball.
1;1;2021-04-27 11:08:50.456208;I like to run around the bases.
1;3;2021-04-27 11:09:11.456208;I like to slide into the bases.
1;2;2021-04-27 11:10:10.456208;Yeah. It's a lot of fun to slide.
1;2;2021-04-27 11:10:59.456208;I want to be a baseball player when I grow up.
1;2;2021-04-27 11:12:24.456208;Me too. I want to play for the Yankees.
1;1;2021-04-27 11:12:34.456208;Not me. I want to play for the Dodgers.
1;1;2021-04-27 11:13:02.456208;We have to practice every day.
1;1;2021-04-27 11:13:25.456208;I don't like practice.
1;2;2021-04-27 11:13:59.456208;Me neither. It's boring.
1;3;2021-04-27 11:14:55.456208;But practice makes perfect.
1;2;2021-04-27 11:16:35.456208;What did you do?
1;2;2021-04-27 11:17:22.456208;I watered all the plants.
1;3;2021-04-27 11:17:57.456208;You have a lot of plants.
1;3;2021-04-27 11:19:35.456208;Then I did my laundry.
1;3;2021-04-27 11:20:30.456208;Did you do the laundry?
1;3;2021-04-27 11:21:38.456208;Yes, I did.
1;1;2021-04-27 11:21:49.456208;What did you wash?
1;2;2021-04-27 11:23:02.456208;I washed the sheets and towels.
1;2;2021-04-27 11:24:01.456208;What about the pillowcases?
1;1;2021-04-27 11:24:25.456208;Yes, I took them off the pillows and washed them.
1;1;2021-04-27 11:25:27.456208;Did you dry everything in the dryer?
1;1;2021-04-27 11:26:39.456208;Yes, I dried everything in the dryer.
1;2;2021-04-27 11:27:53.456208;Then what did you do?
1;1;2021-04-27 11:28:42.456208;I folded all the towels.
1;1;2021-04-27 11:29:20.456208;Did you put the sheets on the beds?
1;3;2021-04-27 11:30:34.456208;Yes, and I put the pillowcases on the pillows
1;2;2021-04-27 11:32:27.456208;Do you listen to the radio?
1;3;2021-04-27 11:34:19.456208;I listen day and night.
1;3;2021-04-27 11:35:54.456208;What do you listen to?
1;1;2021-04-27 11:37:10.456208;Mostly talk radio.
1;1;2021-04-27 11:37:34.456208;What's that?
1;2;2021-04-27 11:37:44.456208;People talk about current events.
1;3;2021-04-27 11:38:42.456208;What do they say?
1;3;2021-04-27 11:39:13.456208;They say they want change.
1;3;2021-04-27 11:40:49.456208;What kind of change?
1;1;2021-04-27 11:41:30.456208;They want tax cuts.
1;3;2021-04-27 11:43:07.456208;Why do they want tax cuts?
1;1;2021-04-27 11:44:40.456208;Because tax cuts will save them money.
1;1;2021-04-27 11:45:48.456208;What is there to eat?
1;2;2021-04-27 11:47:24.456208;I don't know. Look in the fridge.
1;3;2021-04-27 11:47:57.456208;Where's the mustard?
1;3;2021-04-27 11:49:43.456208;It's in the fridge, I think.
1;2;2021-04-27 11:50:47.456208;Do you want a sandwich?
1;3;2021-04-27 11:52:09.456208;Yes, that sounds nice.
1;1;2021-04-27 11:53:04.456208;How about some potato chips?
1;1;2021-04-27 11:54:04.456208;Yes. And a pickle, if we have any.

1;3;2021-04-27 15:18:01.456208;We just moved here last year.
1;3;2021-04-27 15:19:57.456208;It's a beautiful home. You've done a great job decorating it.
1;3;2021-04-27 15:20:18.456208;That would be wonderful.
1;3;2021-04-27 15:21:05.456208;I can offer you lemonade, iced tea, or mango juice.
1;2;2021-04-27 15:21:48.456208;Iced tea sounds really good right now!
1;2;2021-04-27 15:23:06.456208;Do you want to go to the beach tonight?
1;2;2021-04-27 15:24:09.456208;Sure
1;3;2021-04-27 15:25:33.456208;which beach are we going to?
1;2;2021-04-27 15:27:18.456208;I wanted to go to Malibu beach.
1;3;2021-04-27 15:27:52.456208;Is Malibu beach nice?
1;1;2021-04-27 15:28:13.456208;It's a lot nicer, and I really like it better.
1;2;2021-04-27 15:29:59.456208;So you want to go to Malibu?
1;1;2021-04-27 15:30:17.456208;Sure, let's go to Malibu
1;3;2021-04-27 15:30:44.456208;What are you doing this weekend?
1;3;2021-04-27 15:32:00.456208;I am not sure.
1;1;2021-04-27 15:32:12.456208;What are you doing?
1;3;2021-04-27 15:33:29.456208;I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach.
1;1;2021-04-27 15:35:00.456208;When would you be leaving?
1;2;2021-04-27 15:36:45.456208;I thought that we could leave around 8:00 on Saturday morning.
1;3;2021-04-27 15:36:58.456208;What time are you leaving?
1;3;2021-04-27 15:37:31.456208;I think that Saturday morning around 8:00 would work out well.
1;1;2021-04-27 15:38:49.456208;how are you doing today?
1;3;2021-04-27 15:39:29.456208;Pretty good.
1;3;2021-04-27 15:40:01.456208;Do you know how to get there?
1;2;2021-04-27 15:41:25.456208;yes i know
1;1;2021-04-27 15:42:23.456208;Would you like some help with the food?
1;1;2021-04-27 15:42:46.456208;Just bring along whatever it is that you and Jake would like to drink.
1;3;2021-04-27 15:44:19.456208;Are you feeling OK?
1;3;2021-04-27 15:45:52.456208;My stomach is bothering me.
1;2;2021-04-27 15:46:30.456208;What have you been eating?
1;3;2021-04-27 15:47:37.456208;I had a ham sandwich with mayonnaise for lunch.
1;2;2021-04-27 15:48:09.456208;Maybe the food had something wrong with it.
1;3;2021-04-27 15:49:30.456208;It could be bad food, but I didn't feel so well yesterday, either.
1;2;2021-04-27 15:50:23.456208;Have you been under a lot of pressure lately?
1;3;2021-04-27 15:51:40.456208;I haven't been under any more stress than usual.
1;1;2021-04-27 15:52:16.456208;Good morning, is this Ryan?
1;2;2021-04-27 15:52:44.456208;You are speaking with Ryan.
1;3;2021-04-27 15:53:50.456208;What seems to be the problem?
1;1;2021-04-27 15:54:58.456208;I went hiking and have terrible poison oak.
1;2;2021-04-27 15:56:13.456208;When did you get that?
1;2;2021-04-27 15:58:05.456208;I think I got it on Saturday, but it just showed up today.
1;3;2021-04-27 15:58:27.456208;Have you been having any problems lately?
1;3;2021-04-27 15:58:59.456208;No, but the nurse at school says that I should have my blood pressure checked.
1;2;2021-04-27 16:00:23.456208;Do you have a history of high blood pressure?
1;1;2021-04-27 16:02:11.456208;No, I have never been told that I have high blood pressure.
1;3;2021-04-27 16:03:13.456208;How do you check for high blood pressure?
1;3;2021-04-27 16:03:36.456208;We are going to use this cuff here, and it will give me a reading.
1;1;2021-04-27 16:04:57.456208;What do the numbers mean?
1;1;2021-04-27 16:06:48.456208;They tell me how much your heart is working at rest and when pumping blood.
1;1;2021-04-27 16:06:58.456208;How are you doing?
1;3;2021-04-27 16:07:15.456208;I am doing well

1;2;2021-04-27 16:54:40.456208;Do you have enough time to get the right amount of sleep?
1;3;2021-04-27 16:55:00.456208;I have enough time. I just can't seem to fall asleep and stay asleep.

1;1;2021-04-27 16:56:44.456208;I don't have one time in particular. I just go to sleep whenever I feel tired.

1;1;2021-04-27 21:21:17.456208;I am not interested in purchasing the car right now.
1;3;2021-04-27 21:21:49.456208;What's the problem?
1;3;2021-04-27 21:23:04.456208;Actually, I have several other cars to look at before I make my decision.
1;2;2021-04-27 21:24:27.456208;What didn't you like about the car?
1;1;2021-04-27 21:26:00.456208;It is a combination of things, but I appreciate your time.

1;1;2021-04-27 21:31:37.456208;I don't think that this is the car for me at this point in time.
1;1;2021-04-27 21:32:32.456208;Is there something in particular that didn't look good to you?
1;2;2021-04-27 21:34:15.456208;It isn't one thing in particular, but I think I can do better for my money.

1;2;2021-04-27 21:41:43.456208;I looked at the price of the type of insurance that I wanted.
1;3;2021-04-27 21:42:07.456208;What should I think about in choosing services?

2;4;2021-04-27 12:43:26.468208;I wrote the check out for too much.
2;4;2021-04-27 12:44:48.468208;How much did you write it out for?
2;5;2021-04-27 12:46:35.468208;I wrote it out for $150.
2;4;2021-04-27 12:47:15.468208;How much was it supposed to be?
2;4;2021-04-27 12:48:39.468208;It was supposed to be for $100.
2;2;2021-04-27 12:49:47.468208;I'll cancel that check for you.

2;2;2021-04-27 12:58:52.468208;How much?
2;3;2021-04-27 12:59:41.468208;I wrote the check out for $150.
2;5;2021-04-27 13:01:37.468208;What were you supposed to write it out for?
2;2;2021-04-27 13:01:58.468208;I was supposed to write the check out for $100.
2;2;2021-04-27 13:03:42.468208;I'll just cancel it for you right now.
2;2;2021-04-27 13:05:17.468208;That's great. You're a lifesaver.

2;2;2021-04-27 13:20:37.468208;Hi
2;3;2021-04-27 13:20:48.468208;Greetings
2;2;2021-04-27 13:22:37.468208;What do I have to do?
2;4;2021-04-27 13:23:57.468208;Slide your card into the machine.
2;3;2021-04-27 13:25:40.468208;Then what?
2;3;2021-04-27 13:25:58.468208;You need to type your PIN in.
2;4;2021-04-27 13:26:44.468208;What do I have to do next?
2;2;2021-04-27 13:27:01.468208;Click on whichever option you want, and you're done.
2;2;2021-04-27 13:28:40.468208;I have to use the ATM.
2;2;2021-04-27 13:28:52.468208;Is there a problem?
2;3;2021-04-27 13:30:51.468208;I don't know how to use it.
2;2;2021-04-27 13:31:45.468208;What are you talking about?
2;4;2021-04-27 13:32:14.468208;I have never used an ATM before.
2;5;2021-04-27 13:33:00.468208;I can show you how to use it.
2;4;2021-04-27 13:33:20.468208;How do I use it?
2;5;2021-04-27 13:34:30.468208;You need to push your card into the machine.
2;2;2021-04-27 13:35:24.468208;What's next?
2;2;2021-04-27 13:35:54.468208;Enter your PIN.
2;5;2021-04-27 13:36:11.468208;What else do I have to do?
2;4;2021-04-27 13:36:56.468208;Every option you can choose will appear on the screen. That's about it.
2;5;2021-04-27 13:37:32.468208;So, why don't you?
2;5;2021-04-27 13:39:28.468208;I have no idea how to use the ATM.
2;4;2021-04-27 13:40:40.468208;What do you mean?
2;3;2021-04-27 13:41:45.468208;This will be my first time using an ATM.
2;2;2021-04-27 13:43:27.468208;Now what do I do?
2;3;2021-04-27 13:44:33.468208;Then you need to type in your PIN.
2;3;2021-04-27 13:45:03.468208;Now what?
2;4;2021-04-27 13:45:16.468208;Just click on one of the choices they give you, and that's it.
2;4;2021-04-27 13:45:31.468208;Do you have any other questions?
2;2;2021-04-27 13:46:11.468208;I want to know about fees.
2;5;2021-04-27 13:47:56.468208;Which fees?
2;3;2021-04-27 13:48:38.468208;Overdraft fees.
2;2;2021-04-27 13:50:25.468208;How much is the fee?
2;4;2021-04-27 13:51:02.468208;You'll have to pay $25 every time you overdraft.
2;4;2021-04-27 13:51:45.468208;That's a small fee?
2;5;2021-04-27 13:52:46.468208;It should stop you from overdrafting.
2;4;2021-04-27 13:53:26.468208;Can I help you with anything else?
2;2;2021-04-27 13:55:14.468208;That's it for today. Thank you.
2;3;2021-04-27 13:55:41.468208;Do you have any questions?

2;5;2021-04-27 13:57:32.468208;What fees are you referring to?
2;2;2021-04-27 13:58:58.468208;I want to know about overdraft fees.
2;3;2021-04-27 14:00:22.468208;We charge a small fee every time you overdraft.
2;5;2021-04-27 14:00:44.468208;How much?
2;3;2021-04-27 14:02:23.468208;Do you need help with anything else?
2;5;2021-04-27 14:02:45.468208;That's all I needed to know. Thanks.

2;4;2021-04-27 14:05:12.468208;What kind of fees?
2;3;2021-04-27 14:05:51.468208;I'm asking about overdraft fees.
2;5;2021-04-27 14:07:10.468208;How is that a small fee?
2;4;2021-04-27 14:07:36.468208;That fee should keep you from overdrafting.
2;3;2021-04-27 14:09:19.468208;Do you have any more questions?
2;2;2021-04-27 14:11:14.468208;I don't need to know anything else. Thank you.
2;5;2021-04-27 14:12:35.468208;How may I help you today?
2;5;2021-04-27 14:13:50.468208;I need to open a second account.
2;2;2021-04-27 14:14:13.468208;What kind of account would you like to open?

2;3;2021-04-27 16:09:32.468208;Do I need to bring anything?

2;4;2021-04-27 16:12:49.468208;I was wondering if the apartment on Main Street is still available.
2;4;2021-04-27 16:13:48.468208;Are you interested in seeing it?
2;5;2021-04-27 16:15:10.468208;Yes, I would love to see

2;3;2021-04-27 16:16:24.468208;No. I might need to see your ID card, but that's about it.
2;2;2021-04-27 16:16:46.468208;Could I speak to the apartment manager?

2;2;2021-04-27 16:21:44.468208;That time is okay with me.
2;2;2021-04-27 16:22:02.468208;Do I need to bring anything myself?
2;5;2021-04-27 16:22:28.468208;No. The only thing I need to see is your driver's license.
2;4;2021-04-27 16:23:00.468208;What can I do for you?
2;3;2021-04-27 16:23:43.468208;I'm interested in the apartment on Main Street.
2;2;2021-04-27 16:25:30.468208;Do you want to see it?
2;2;2021-04-27 16:26:25.468208;Yes, I would very much like to see it.

2;5;2021-04-27 16:27:54.468208;I have no problem with 6 p.m.
2;5;2021-04-27 16:29:19.468208;Do you need any directions?
2;5;2021-04-27 16:30:38.468208;No, thanks. I already drove by to see what the neighborhood looks like.
2;4;2021-04-27 16:31:57.468208;Should I bring anything with me?
2;4;2021-04-27 16:33:37.468208;No. I only need to check your driver's license.
2;2;2021-04-27 16:35:18.468208;How can I help you?
2;5;2021-04-27 16:37:01.468208;I was hoping that the apartment on Main Street was still available.
2;3;2021-04-27 16:37:47.468208;Is there anything that I need to bring with me?
2;2;2021-04-27 16:39:45.468208;No. I won't need to see anything except your driver's license.
2;4;2021-04-27 16:41:10.468208;Hi. How can I help you today?
2;2;2021-04-27 16:41:59.468208;Well, my window facing the empty lot is broken.
2;4;2021-04-27 16:43:13.468208;Oh, that's not good. What happened?
2;4;2021-04-27 16:43:33.468208;I dont know. I wasn't home when it happened.
2;4;2021-04-27 16:44:45.468208;Do you have any clue who might have done this?
2;3;2021-04-27 16:46:29.468208;I have a feeling that it might have been the neighborhood kids.
2;4;2021-04-27 16:47:08.468208;Why, what leads you to that suspicion?
2;5;2021-04-27 16:48:44.468208;Well, next to the broken glass was a baseball.
2;4;2021-04-27 16:49:37.468208;Hello. What can I do for you today?
2;4;2021-04-27 16:50:39.468208;My living room window is broken.

2;3;2021-04-27 16:53:11.468208;no
2;4;2021-04-27 16:54:41.468208;Do you know any of them?
2;3;2021-04-27 16:55:57.468208;No, I didn't pay any attention to who they were.
2;2;2021-04-27 16:56:15.468208;What can I do for you?
2;2;2021-04-27 16:57:00.468208;Something happened to my window. It's broken.
2;4;2021-04-27 16:57:55.468208;How about if I call a friend of mine who is a repairman?
2;2;2021-04-27 16:58:13.468208;That's no problem. I'll come by right now to look at the damage.
2;5;2021-04-27 16:59:29.468208;How may I help you?
2;5;2021-04-27 16:59:40.468208;My window that faces the empty lot is broken.

2;4;2021-04-27 17:07:15.468208;Can you tell me which credit card it was for?
2;5;2021-04-27 17:07:58.468208;It was for my Master Card.
2;2;2021-04-27 17:09:28.468208;What am I supposed to do about my bill then?
2;2;2021-04-27 17:11:21.468208;Maybe you should call your post office.
2;5;2021-04-27 17:12:39.468208;can I get an extension on my bill payment?
2;3;2021-04-27 17:14:09.468208;Yes, but you will need to send us proof of their mistake.

2;5;2021-04-27 17:17:29.468208;If you haven't gotten it yet, then you should probably take that up with your post office.

2;5;2021-04-27 17:44:54.468208;What does this new service include?
2;4;2021-04-27 17:46:30.468208;It makes the Internet connection twice as fast.

2;5;2021-04-27 17:48:53.468208;I am having problems with my Internet service.
2;4;2021-04-27 17:49:19.468208;What seems to be the problem?
2;5;2021-04-27 17:50:23.468208;None of my wireless devices are connecting to the Wi-Fi.
2;4;2021-04-27 17:50:49.468208;Have you tried disconnecting and reconnecting the modem?
2;4;2021-04-27 17:52:21.468208;No,how do I do that?
2;4;2021-04-27 17:53:55.468208;Are all of the lights back on the modem?
2;5;2021-04-27 17:54:13.468208;Yes,they're all green!
2;4;2021-04-27 17:54:44.468208;Hello, is this the Smith residence?
2;5;2021-04-27 17:55:48.468208;Hello, how can I help you today?
2;5;2021-04-27 17:56:57.468208;I am very upset with the quality of your service.

2;4;2021-04-27 17:58:45.468208;My Internet service did not work for three days.
2;3;2021-04-27 18:00:35.468208;My records say a technician visited your area yesterday?
2;5;2021-04-27 18:01:43.468208;Yes,he installed a new modem.
2;2;2021-04-27 18:02:54.468208;Did it solve the problem?
2;2;2021-04-27 18:04:12.468208;Yes,but I was overcharged for Internet service.
2;5;2021-04-27 18:04:31.468208;Sorry about that.
2;3;2021-04-27 18:04:52.468208;I was sold a wireless service unavailable in my area.
2;2;2021-04-27 18:06:10.468208;I see it here,we charged you $5 extra a month.
2;4;2021-04-27 18:06:33.468208;How may I help you?
2;4;2021-04-27 18:06:43.468208;My computer is not letting me run JavaScript.
2;3;2021-04-27 18:07:00.468208;That can easily be fixed.
2;2;2021-04-27 18:08:45.468208;I've tried fixing it myself, but nothing worked.
2;2;2021-04-27 18:09:58.468208;Hello? I'd like to schedule an appointment.
2;5;2021-04-27 18:11:46.468208;Hello!What time would you like to come in?
2;4;2021-04-27 18:13:45.468208;Can I have your name?
2;4;2021-04-27 18:13:56.468208;My name is Sarah.
2;3;2021-04-27 18:14:17.468208;Alright,thank you!
2;5;2021-04-27 18:15:17.468208;See you soon!
2;4;2021-04-27 18:17:05.468208;I don't have any clean laundry for tomorrow!
2;3;2021-04-27 18:17:29.468208;Well,you should do your laundry then.
2;2;2021-04-27 18:18:05.468208;Do you have any quarters?
2;3;2021-04-27 18:19:17.468208;Yes.I have enough for the washer and dryer.
2;5;2021-04-27 18:19:36.468208;Alright then,let us get going.
2;5;2021-04-27 18:20:38.468208;This is going to take forever.
2;4;2021-04-27 18:21:56.468208;How long should I put them in for?
2;4;2021-04-27 18:22:26.468208;Put them on low heat for thirty minutes.
2;5;2021-04-27 18:24:07.468208;Why low heat?
2;3;2021-04-27 18:25:54.468208;If the air is too hot,the clothes will shrink.
2;5;2021-04-27 18:26:42.468208;Does warm water make them fade?
2;5;2021-04-27 18:28:24.468208;Yes.Put the detergent here,and don't use bleach.
2;3;2021-04-27 18:29:21.468208;Excuse me,Can I borrow your fabric softener?
2;3;2021-04-27 18:30:28.468208;Of course,take as much as you need.
2;4;2021-04-27 18:31:49.468208;Thank you.You're very kind.
2;3;2021-04-27 18:33:42.468208;Itis no problem at all.
2;2;2021-04-27 18:34:30.468208;I love the subtle smell of this brand
2;2;2021-04-27 18:34:56.468208;Me too,It is not overpowering or strong.
2;4;2021-04-27 18:36:26.468208;Hello, is this the Smith residence?
2;3;2021-04-27 18:38:08.468208;Sarah! Hurry up and get out of bed!
2;5;2021-04-27 18:38:25.468208;Why I do it every morning?
2;3;2021-04-27 18:38:56.468208;If you don't get out of bed, you'll get to school late.
2;4;2021-04-27 18:39:38.468208;How is it not so bad?
2;4;2021-04-27 18:41:19.468208;Sleep is good for growing children.
2;4;2021-04-27 18:41:52.468208;Hello,is this Mr. Smith? I'm Mrs. Jones.
2;4;2021-04-27 18:43:24.468208;Hello,Mrs.Jones.Did you get my message?
2;4;2021-04-27 18:43:40.468208;What is the purpose of this meeting exactly?
2;4;2021-04-27 18:44:51.468208;I just wanted to let you know that James is doing very well.
2;4;2021-04-27 18:46:13.468208;What about history?
2;3;2021-04-27 18:48:10.468208;Only the parts about Woodstock.
2;4;2021-04-27 18:49:23.468208;Hello,is this the Smith residence?
2;4;2021-04-27 18:49:36.468208;Children,it is time to go to bed!
2;4;2021-04-27 18:50:22.468208;But we're not sleepy yet!
2;5;2021-04-27 18:50:32.468208;If you get into bed right now, I'll read you a fairytale.
2;2;2021-04-27 18:52:01.468208;Why do we hear fairytales before bed?
2;4;2021-04-27 18:53:51.468208;So that the magic from stories can grow while you're sleeping.
2;2;2021-04-27 18:55:12.468208;Hello,is this the Smith residence?
2;3;2021-04-27 18:56:07.468208;David!Clean your room.It is filthy!
2;5;2021-04-27 18:56:45.468208;Have you no shame?
2;3;2021-04-27 18:57:19.468208;What should I be ashamed of?
2;4;2021-04-27 18:58:11.468208;There are clothes all over the ground!
2;2;2021-04-27 19:00:05.468208;It is just easier to leave them there.
2;4;2021-04-27 19:01:29.468208;I think these puppies are hungry!
2;2;2021-04-27 19:02:20.468208;They've done nothing but play all day.
2;5;2021-04-27 19:04:08.468208;Do you think they're old enough to eat kibble?
2;2;2021-04-27 19:04:39.468208;They're six weeks old; I think they're old enough.
2;2;2021-04-27 19:06:06.468208;Look!They're digging right in!
2;5;2021-04-27 19:07:13.468208;Now they're settling for a nap.
2;2;2021-04-27 19:08:56.468208;Between keeping them from chewing things and cleaning, they're a hassle.
2;5;2021-04-27 19:09:58.468208;Yeah,they are.But look how cute they are while asleep!
2;4;2021-04-27 19:10:36.468208;Suddenly,I don't mind the chores so much.
2;5;2021-04-27 19:12:17.468208;Yeah, neither do I.
2;2;2021-04-27 19:14:12.468208;These puppies are truly worth it.
2;3;2021-04-27 19:14:37.468208;I wouldn't lose a single minute with them
2;4;2021-04-27 19:15:10.468208;Hello,is this the Smith residence?
2;3;2021-04-27 19:16:35.468208;yes
2;3;2021-04-27 19:18:04.468208;What is for dinner?
2;4;2021-04-27 19:18:28.468208;I should be asking you that.
2;5;2021-04-27 19:19:28.468208;Why do you say that?
2;5;2021-04-27 19:20:30.468208;You're old enough to cook dinner.

2;4;2021-04-27 19:23:25.468208;Actually, thatis exactly what I'm saying.
2;5;2021-04-27 19:23:54.468208;What would you like to eat,then?
2;2;2021-04-27 19:24:30.468208;I'm craving some spaghetti,bread and even a salad.
2;4;2021-04-27 19:26:25.468208;Can you even cook?
2;4;2021-04-27 19:27:18.468208;Of course I can cook!I choose not to.
2;3;2021-04-27 19:27:58.468208;Hello, how are you doing?
2;5;2021-04-27 19:29:55.468208;I am doing quite well,how are you?
2;5;2021-04-27 19:30:40.468208;I've been better,I'm completely swamped with work.
2;5;2021-04-27 19:31:22.468208;I know the feeling
2;4;2021-04-27 19:32:59.468208;How are the kids?
2;3;2021-04-27 19:34:19.468208;They are good.The oldest is about to graduate from high school.
2;3;2021-04-27 19:35:42.468208;You're kidding me!Thatis great, man.
2;4;2021-04-27 19:37:00.468208;The youngest is about to start middle school soon.
2;4;2021-04-27 19:38:40.468208;My son is about to start middle school as well.
2;5;2021-04-27 19:39:37.468208;Hey, maybe they will be classmates.
2;5;2021-04-27 19:40:31.468208;Good morning.How are you today?
2;5;2021-04-27 19:42:25.468208;I'm fantastic.How about yourself?
2;5;2021-04-27 19:44:17.468208;That is great! I'm good,but I feel a little sick.
2;4;2021-04-27 19:44:57.468208;That is not good.I heard there is a flu going around.
2;3;2021-04-27 19:45:14.468208;Well,I have to be sure to take good care of myself.
2;3;2021-04-27 19:45:45.468208;Sucks that you aren't feeling well,it is a nice day.
2;3;2021-04-27 19:47:41.468208;The sunshine makes me want to go to the beach.
2;2;2021-04-27 19:49:10.468208;That is a great idea,but I think you'll get sicker if you go.
2;4;2021-04-27 19:50:30.468208;can we go some other time?
2;4;2021-04-27 19:51:08.468208;For sure
2;2;2021-04-27 19:51:29.468208;Sounds like a plan.I'll talk to you later.
2;4;2021-04-27 19:53:11.468208;Cool,see you later.
2;5;2021-04-27 19:53:48.468208;Everything is going wrong today.
2;2;2021-04-27 19:54:38.468208;Well,at least the weather is nice.
2;5;2021-04-27 19:55:12.468208;Yeah,I love when the sun is shining, but itis not too hot.
2;4;2021-04-27 19:56:59.468208;I do,too.
2;4;2021-04-27 19:58:48.468208;This weather is pretty sweet.
2;4;2021-04-27 19:59:06.468208;I guess everything will be okay in the end.
2;2;2021-04-27 20:00:33.468208;So all you needed was some sunshine.
2;4;2021-04-27 20:00:58.468208;Yeah,I guess you were right for once.
2;4;2021-04-27 20:01:10.468208;Hey I'm always right
2;4;2021-04-27 20:01:32.468208;Quick! Get in here and wait out the storm!
2;4;2021-04-27 20:02:13.468208;Oh,my word
2;2;2021-04-27 20:02:59.468208;It is raining cats and dogs out there.
2;5;2021-04-27 20:04:54.468208;More like lions and wolves
2;5;2021-04-27 20:05:10.468208;I was watching the news.
2;4;2021-04-27 20:06:09.468208;What did they say?
2;3;2021-04-27 20:07:47.468208;This is going to be one heck of a storm.
2;3;2021-04-27 20:08:36.468208;Should we be worried?
2;2;2021-04-27 20:08:53.468208;I don't think so.
2;2;2021-04-27 20:10:42.468208;True,Well,thank you for saving me from this storm.
2;2;2021-04-27 20:11:00.468208;No problem.I'm making some tea
2;5;2021-04-27 20:11:41.468208;would you like some?

2;4;2021-04-27 20:13:47.468208;Where did you hear that from?
2;5;2021-04-27 20:15:16.468208;The weatherman said there is a high probability of rain.
2;2;2021-04-27 20:15:32.468208;Since when have you started watching the news?
2;5;2021-04-27 20:16:46.468208;I've always watched the news.
2;4;2021-04-27 20:18:31.468208;What else did they say about the weekend?
2;4;2021-04-27 20:19:24.468208;I think they said it was going to rain throughout the weekend.
2;3;2021-04-27 20:21:15.468208;Throughout the weekend?
2;5;2021-04-27 20:22:42.468208;Don't pull my chain.
2;5;2021-04-27 20:24:02.468208;I'm not.
2;4;2021-04-27 20:25:05.468208;Okay,suit yourself
2;5;2021-04-27 20:26:28.468208;I won't.
2;4;2021-04-27 20:27:11.468208;I'd rather get wet than listen to you.
2;2;2021-04-27 20:27:26.468208;Why don't you ever answer your phone?
2;4;2021-04-27 20:27:59.468208;I'm usually busy.Whatis up?
2;3;2021-04-27 20:28:52.468208;I wanted to see if you were down to kick it.
2;2;2021-04-27 20:29:09.468208;Where do you want to go?
2;2;2021-04-27 20:30:52.468208;Let us go for a drink at the bar where we went last week.
2;3;2021-04-27 20:32:23.468208;Okay,but I only have enough for three beers.
2;2;2021-04-27 20:33:42.468208;It is fine.I'll pay for the rest
2;3;2021-04-27 20:34:18.468208;I paid for you last time.You owe me!

2;3;2021-04-27 20:43:33.468208;Which one is Sarah?
2;2;2021-04-27 20:44:55.468208;You date so many girls that I get confused.
2;5;2021-04-27 20:45:07.468208;First off,I don't date.
2;4;2021-04-27 20:46:43.468208;So,which one is she?
2;3;2021-04-27 20:48:22.468208;Which girl?
2;4;2021-04-27 20:48:44.468208;The cute one.You know the one with the tattoo up her thigh?
2;4;2021-04-27 20:50:34.468208;I think I would have noticed that.
2;5;2021-04-27 20:52:33.468208;She is the only one with blonde hair.
2;2;2021-04-27 20:53:39.468208;Well.
2;2;2021-04-27 20:54:38.468208;I know you check her out,I assumed you saw the tattoo.
2;2;2021-04-27 20:55:37.468208;I'm not that big of a pervert.
2;3;2021-04-27 20:56:27.468208;I have a new co-worker at work,She is pretty.
2;5;2021-04-27 20:58:22.468208;Oh,yeah?

2;5;2021-04-27 21:01:28.468208;Sheis tall,thin,and wears glasses.

2;3;2021-04-27 21:13:33.468208;Well,ask her out tomorrow,or somebody will.
2;3;2021-04-27 21:14:03.468208;I heard that your brother is in the hospital.

2;2;2021-04-27 21:19:19.468208;The doctors told you he would be alright?
2;5;2021-04-27 21:19:33.468208;Yes,but they need to keep him for further tests.
2;5;2021-04-27 21:20:08.468208;Really lucky.Did anyone else get injured?
2;2;2021-04-27 21:20:24.468208;His girlfriend broke her arm,but that is all.

2;4;2021-04-27 21:41:27.468208;Did it cost a lot?
2;5;2021-04-27 21:42:19.468208;Things are usually overpriced there.
2;2;2021-04-27 21:43:16.468208;Actually,it was quite cheap.I got it for $15.99.

3;4;2021-04-27 12:33:07.480205;What's the problem?
3;4;2021-04-27 12:34:51.480205;I wrote the check out for way too much.
3;4;2021-04-27 12:35:19.480205;How much?
3;6;2021-04-27 12:37:05.480205;I wrote the check out for $150.
3;3;2021-04-27 12:37:30.480205;What were you supposed to write it out for?
3;4;2021-04-27 12:37:42.480205;I was supposed to write the check out for $100.
3;6;2021-04-27 12:39:36.480205;I'll just cancel it for you right now.
3;3;2021-04-27 12:40:08.480205;That's great. You're a lifesaver.
3;3;2021-04-27 12:41:51.480205;How's it going?

3;4;2021-04-27 12:46:58.480205;I accidentally wrote the check for too much.
3;6;2021-04-27 12:47:45.480205;How much did you write the check for?
3;6;2021-04-27 12:48:48.480205;The check was written for $150.

3;3;2021-04-27 12:53:19.480205;Hi
3;5;2021-04-27 12:53:39.480205;Greetings
3;3;2021-04-27 12:55:27.480205;What do I have to do?
3;4;2021-04-27 12:55:54.480205;Slide your card into the machine.
3;6;2021-04-27 12:57:25.480205;Then what?
3;3;2021-04-27 12:58:41.480205;You need to type your PIN in.
3;6;2021-04-27 12:59:30.480205;What do I have to do next?
3;5;2021-04-27 12:59:59.480205;Click on whichever option you want, and you're done.
3;4;2021-04-27 13:00:42.480205;I have to use the ATM.
3;5;2021-04-27 13:01:54.480205;Is there a problem?
3;5;2021-04-27 13:02:16.480205;I don't know how to use it.
3;5;2021-04-27 13:03:08.480205;What are you talking about?
3;5;2021-04-27 13:04:57.480205;I have never used an ATM before.
3;3;2021-04-27 13:05:47.480205;I can show you how to use it.
3;3;2021-04-27 13:07:05.480205;How do I use it?
3;5;2021-04-27 13:07:20.480205;You need to push your card into the machine.
3;4;2021-04-27 13:08:08.480205;What's next?
3;5;2021-04-27 13:08:43.480205;Enter your PIN.
3;5;2021-04-27 13:09:46.480205;What else do I have to do?
3;3;2021-04-27 13:10:10.480205;Every option you can choose will appear on the screen. That's about it.
3;4;2021-04-27 13:11:50.480205;So, why don't you?
3;4;2021-04-27 13:13:19.480205;I have no idea how to use the ATM.
3;4;2021-04-27 13:13:46.480205;What do you mean?
3;5;2021-04-27 13:14:36.480205;This will be my first time using an ATM.
3;5;2021-04-27 13:14:56.480205;Now what do I do?
3;5;2021-04-27 13:15:34.480205;Then you need to type in your PIN.
3;4;2021-04-27 13:16:00.480205;Now what?
3;6;2021-04-27 13:16:48.480205;Just click on one of the choices they give you, and that's it.
3;6;2021-04-27 13:17:02.480205;Do you have any other questions?
3;4;2021-04-27 13:18:42.480205;I want to know about fees.
3;4;2021-04-27 13:19:03.480205;Which fees?
3;6;2021-04-27 13:20:36.480205;Overdraft fees.
3;6;2021-04-27 13:22:25.480205;How much is the fee?
3;5;2021-04-27 13:23:54.480205;You'll have to pay $25 every time you overdraft.
3;4;2021-04-27 13:25:14.480205;That's a small fee?
3;6;2021-04-27 13:25:33.480205;It should stop you from overdrafting.
3;4;2021-04-27 13:25:56.480205;Can I help you with anything else?
3;6;2021-04-27 13:27:39.480205;That's it for today. Thank you.
3;5;2021-04-27 13:29:21.480205;Do you have any questions?

3;5;2021-04-27 13:32:15.480205;What fees are you referring to?
3;6;2021-04-27 13:33:20.480205;I want to know about overdraft fees.
3;5;2021-04-27 13:33:42.480205;We charge a small fee every time you overdraft.
3;6;2021-04-27 13:34:13.480205;How much?
3;6;2021-04-27 13:34:38.480205;Do you need help with anything else?
3;6;2021-04-27 13:36:03.480205;That's all I needed to know. Thanks.
3;6;2021-04-27 13:37:54.480205;Would you like to ask any questions?

3;4;2021-04-27 13:40:24.480205;What kind of fees?
3;4;2021-04-27 13:41:02.480205;I'm asking about overdraft fees.
3;6;2021-04-27 13:42:10.480205;How is that a small fee?
3;5;2021-04-27 13:42:50.480205;That fee should keep you from overdrafting.
3;4;2021-04-27 13:44:03.480205;Do you have any more questions?
3;4;2021-04-27 13:45:07.480205;I don't need to know anything else. Thank you.
3;5;2021-04-27 13:45:35.480205;How may I help you today?

3;5;2021-04-27 13:48:11.480205;What kind of account would you like to open?

3;3;2021-04-27 15:54:12.480205;I wanted to know if that apartment on Main Street is still for rent.
3;6;2021-04-27 15:55:10.480205;How about today?
3;6;2021-04-27 15:55:49.480205;That time is okay with me.
3;6;2021-04-27 15:56:14.480205;Do I need to bring anything myself?
3;4;2021-04-27 15:57:39.480205;No. The only thing I need to see is your driver's license.
3;5;2021-04-27 15:58:08.480205;What can I do for you?
3;5;2021-04-27 16:00:01.480205;I'm interested in the apartment on Main Street.
3;5;2021-04-27 16:01:18.480205;Do you want to see it?
3;3;2021-04-27 16:02:02.480205;Yes, I would very much like to see it.
3;3;2021-04-27 16:02:41.480205;Does today at 6 p.m. sound okay to you?
3;5;2021-04-27 16:03:28.480205;I have no problem with 6 p.m.
3;5;2021-04-27 16:03:40.480205;Do you need any directions?
3;5;2021-04-27 16:04:46.480205;No, thanks. I already drove by to see what the neighborhood looks like.
3;3;2021-04-27 16:05:55.480205;Should I bring anything with me?
3;5;2021-04-27 16:06:46.480205;No. I only need to check your driver's license.
3;6;2021-04-27 16:07:15.480205;How can I help you?
3;4;2021-04-27 16:09:08.480205;I was hoping that the apartment on Main Street was still available.
3;3;2021-04-27 16:10:59.480205;Is there anything that I need to bring with me?
3;4;2021-04-27 16:12:06.480205;No. I won't need to see anything except your driver's license.
3;4;2021-04-27 16:13:54.480205;Hi. How can I help you today?
3;6;2021-04-27 16:14:47.480205;Well, my window facing the empty lot is broken.
3;4;2021-04-27 16:15:43.480205;Oh, that's not good. What happened?
3;3;2021-04-27 16:16:59.480205;I dont know. I wasn't home when it happened.
3;3;2021-04-27 16:18:58.480205;Do you have any clue who might have done this?
3;5;2021-04-27 16:19:17.480205;I have a feeling that it might have been the neighborhood kids.
3;3;2021-04-27 16:20:18.480205;Why, what leads you to that suspicion?
3;5;2021-04-27 16:21:02.480205;Well, next to the broken glass was a baseball.
3;6;2021-04-27 16:22:20.480205;Hello. What can I do for you today?
3;3;2021-04-27 16:23:19.480205;My living room window is broken.
3;3;2021-04-27 16:24:17.480205;Are you serious?
3;6;2021-04-27 16:24:52.480205;no
3;3;2021-04-27 16:25:31.480205;Do you know any of them?
3;6;2021-04-27 16:26:13.480205;No, I didn't pay any attention to who they were.
3;6;2021-04-27 16:27:03.480205;What can I do for you?
3;6;2021-04-27 16:27:40.480205;Something happened to my window. It's broken.
3;5;2021-04-27 16:29:36.480205;How about if I call a friend of mine who is a repairman?
3;3;2021-04-27 16:31:10.480205;That's no problem. I'll come by right now to look at the damage.
3;4;2021-04-27 16:33:03.480205;How may I help you?
3;6;2021-04-27 16:34:22.480205;My window that faces the empty lot is broken.
3;3;2021-04-27 16:36:06.480205;Hi

3;3;2021-04-27 16:42:54.480205;Can you tell me which credit card it was for?
3;5;2021-04-27 16:43:16.480205;It was for my Master Card.
3;6;2021-04-27 16:43:47.480205;What am I supposed to do about my bill then?
3;3;2021-04-27 16:44:52.480205;Maybe you should call your post office.
3;3;2021-04-27 16:45:06.480205;can I get an extension on my bill payment?
3;5;2021-04-27 16:46:56.480205;Yes, but you will need to send us proof of their mistake.
3;4;2021-04-27 16:48:27.480205;Thank you very much for your help.
3;5;2021-04-27 16:49:50.480205;Enjoy the rest of your day.
3;5;2021-04-27 16:51:42.480205;What am I going to do since I haven't received the bill?
3;4;2021-04-27 16:53:34.480205;If you haven't gotten it yet, then you should probably take that up with your post office.
3;5;2021-04-27 16:54:13.480205;Thanks for your help
3;5;2021-04-27 16:55:56.480205;Nice. Have a great day ahead.

3;4;2021-04-27 17:19:42.480205;Alright,I see you use our mobile service.
3;4;2021-04-27 17:21:03.480205;Yes.I also have a landline.
3;3;2021-04-27 17:21:23.480205;What does this new service include?
3;4;2021-04-27 17:22:39.480205;It makes the Internet connection twice as fast.
3;5;2021-04-27 17:24:16.480205;This is Tech Support,how may I help you?
3;6;2021-04-27 17:25:18.480205;I am having problems with my Internet service.
3;4;2021-04-27 17:25:43.480205;What seems to be the problem?
3;6;2021-04-27 17:27:00.480205;None of my wireless devices are connecting to the Wi-Fi.
3;6;2021-04-27 17:27:21.480205;Have you tried disconnecting and reconnecting the modem?
3;6;2021-04-27 17:27:45.480205;No,how do I do that?
3;3;2021-04-27 17:29:25.480205;Are all of the lights back on the modem?
3;4;2021-04-27 17:31:02.480205;Yes,they're all green!
3;4;2021-04-27 17:31:48.480205;Hello, is this the Smith residence?
3;6;2021-04-27 17:33:14.480205;Hello, how can I help you today?
3;3;2021-04-27 17:35:01.480205;I am very upset with the quality of your service.
3;6;2021-04-27 17:35:34.480205;I'm sorry, what seems to be the problem?
3;6;2021-04-27 17:35:52.480205;My Internet service did not work for three days.
3;4;2021-04-27 17:37:17.480205;My records say a technician visited your area yesterday?
3;6;2021-04-27 17:37:32.480205;Yes,he installed a new modem.
3;5;2021-04-27 17:38:39.480205;Did it solve the problem?
3;6;2021-04-27 17:39:42.480205;Yes,but I was overcharged for Internet service.
3;6;2021-04-27 17:40:13.480205;Sorry about that.
3;5;2021-04-27 17:41:30.480205;I was sold a wireless service unavailable in my area.
3;5;2021-04-27 17:42:58.480205;I see it here,we charged you $5 extra a month.
3;5;2021-04-27 17:44:27.480205;How may I help you?
3;3;2021-04-27 17:45:49.480205;My computer is not letting me run JavaScript.
3;4;2021-04-27 17:46:30.480205;That can easily be fixed.
3;6;2021-04-27 17:46:47.480205;I've tried fixing it myself, but nothing worked.
3;5;2021-04-27 17:47:43.480205;Hello? I'd like to schedule an appointment.
3;3;2021-04-27 17:48:11.480205;Hello!What time would you like to come in?
3;3;2021-04-27 17:50:00.480205;Can I have your name?
3;3;2021-04-27 17:51:30.480205;My name is Sarah.
3;5;2021-04-27 17:52:13.480205;Alright,thank you!
3;4;2021-04-27 17:54:05.480205;See you soon!
3;3;2021-04-27 17:54:23.480205;I don't have any clean laundry for tomorrow!
3;6;2021-04-27 17:55:26.480205;Well,you should do your laundry then.
3;6;2021-04-27 17:56:59.480205;Do you have any quarters?
3;3;2021-04-27 17:58:52.480205;Yes.I have enough for the washer and dryer.
3;4;2021-04-27 17:59:04.480205;Alright then,let us get going.
3;5;2021-04-27 18:01:03.480205;This is going to take forever.
3;4;2021-04-27 18:01:21.480205;How long should I put them in for?
3;5;2021-04-27 18:02:48.480205;Put them on low heat for thirty minutes.
3;6;2021-04-27 18:03:26.480205;Why low heat?
3;6;2021-04-27 18:03:58.480205;If the air is too hot,the clothes will shrink.
3;4;2021-04-27 18:05:00.480205;Does warm water make them fade?
3;6;2021-04-27 18:05:29.480205;Yes.Put the detergent here,and don't use bleach.
3;5;2021-04-27 18:07:24.480205;Excuse me,Can I borrow your fabric softener?
3;6;2021-04-27 18:08:31.480205;Of course,take as much as you need.
3;5;2021-04-27 18:10:26.480205;Thank you.You're very kind.
3;6;2021-04-27 18:11:51.480205;Itis no problem at all.
3;4;2021-04-27 18:12:51.480205;I love the subtle smell of this brand
3;5;2021-04-27 18:13:51.480205;Me too,It is not overpowering or strong.
3;3;2021-04-27 18:14:38.480205;Hello, is this the Smith residence?
3;4;2021-04-27 18:15:09.480205;Sarah! Hurry up and get out of bed!
3;5;2021-04-27 18:16:29.480205;Why I do it every morning?
3;5;2021-04-27 18:16:40.480205;If you don't get out of bed, you'll get to school late.
3;3;2021-04-27 18:18:33.480205;How is it not so bad?
3;5;2021-04-27 18:20:27.480205;Sleep is good for growing children.
3;4;2021-04-27 18:21:32.480205;Hello,is this Mr. Smith? I'm Mrs. Jones.
3;5;2021-04-27 18:21:47.480205;Hello,Mrs.Jones.Did you get my message?
3;3;2021-04-27 18:22:04.480205;What is the purpose of this meeting exactly?
3;3;2021-04-27 18:22:21.480205;I just wanted to let you know that James is doing very well.
3;3;2021-04-27 18:23:32.480205;What about history?
3;6;2021-04-27 18:23:58.480205;Only the parts about Woodstock.
3;3;2021-04-27 18:25:17.480205;Hello,is this the Smith residence?
3;5;2021-04-27 18:26:23.480205;Children,it is time to go to bed!
3;6;2021-04-27 18:27:18.480205;But we're not sleepy yet!
3;5;2021-04-27 18:28:54.480205;If you get into bed right now, I'll read you a fairytale.
3;5;2021-04-27 18:30:52.480205;Why do we hear fairytales before bed?
3;4;2021-04-27 18:32:19.480205;So that the magic from stories can grow while you're sleeping.
3;6;2021-04-27 18:33:40.480205;Hello,is this the Smith residence?
3;5;2021-04-27 18:35:17.480205;David!Clean your room.It is filthy!
3;6;2021-04-27 18:36:58.480205;Have you no shame?
3;4;2021-04-27 18:38:45.480205;What should I be ashamed of?
3;4;2021-04-27 18:40:33.480205;There are clothes all over the ground!
3;4;2021-04-27 18:42:04.480205;It is just easier to leave them there.
3;3;2021-04-27 18:43:03.480205;I think these puppies are hungry!
3;4;2021-04-27 18:44:22.480205;They've done nothing but play all day.
3;3;2021-04-27 18:45:13.480205;Do you think they're old enough to eat kibble?
3;6;2021-04-27 18:45:58.480205;They're six weeks old; I think they're old enough.
3;5;2021-04-27 18:47:09.480205;Look!They're digging right in!
3;6;2021-04-27 18:48:56.480205;Now they're settling for a nap.
3;6;2021-04-27 18:49:43.480205;Between keeping them from chewing things and cleaning, they're a hassle.
3;5;2021-04-27 18:50:26.480205;Yeah,they are.But look how cute they are while asleep!
3;5;2021-04-27 18:51:49.480205;Suddenly,I don't mind the chores so much.
3;5;2021-04-27 18:52:33.480205;Yeah, neither do I.
3;5;2021-04-27 18:54:00.480205;These puppies are truly worth it.
3;4;2021-04-27 18:55:33.480205;I wouldn't lose a single minute with them
3;6;2021-04-27 18:56:36.480205;Hello,is this the Smith residence?
3;6;2021-04-27 18:57:11.480205;yes
3;5;2021-04-27 18:58:38.480205;What is for dinner?
3;4;2021-04-27 18:59:05.480205;I should be asking you that.
3;6;2021-04-27 19:00:55.480205;Why do you say that?
3;5;2021-04-27 19:02:39.480205;You're old enough to cook dinner.
3;6;2021-04-27 19:03:32.480205;Are you saying itis my turn now?
3;4;2021-04-27 19:04:26.480205;Actually, thatis exactly what I'm saying.
3;6;2021-04-27 19:05:53.480205;What would you like to eat,then?
3;4;2021-04-27 19:06:28.480205;I'm craving some spaghetti,bread and even a salad.
3;4;2021-04-27 19:07:14.480205;Can you even cook?
3;4;2021-04-27 19:08:52.480205;Of course I can cook!I choose not to.
3;3;2021-04-27 19:10:28.480205;Hello, how are you doing?
3;4;2021-04-27 19:10:44.480205;I am doing quite well,how are you?
3;4;2021-04-27 19:10:58.480205;I've been better,I'm completely swamped with work.
3;4;2021-04-27 19:11:44.480205;I know the feeling
3;6;2021-04-27 19:12:29.480205;How are the kids?
3;6;2021-04-27 19:14:01.480205;They are good.The oldest is about to graduate from high school.
3;5;2021-04-27 19:14:57.480205;You're kidding me!Thatis great, man.
3;3;2021-04-27 19:15:12.480205;The youngest is about to start middle school soon.
3;5;2021-04-27 19:16:18.480205;My son is about to start middle school as well.
3;4;2021-04-27 19:17:35.480205;Hey, maybe they will be classmates.
3;4;2021-04-27 19:18:03.480205;Good morning.How are you today?
3;6;2021-04-27 19:19:05.480205;I'm fantastic.How about yourself?
3;5;2021-04-27 19:19:36.480205;That is great! I'm good,but I feel a little sick.
3;6;2021-04-27 19:21:33.480205;That is not good.I heard there is a flu going around.
3;4;2021-04-27 19:21:56.480205;Well,I have to be sure to take good care of myself.
3;6;2021-04-27 19:23:32.480205;Sucks that you aren't feeling well,it is a nice day.
3;5;2021-04-27 19:25:06.480205;The sunshine makes me want to go to the beach.
3;4;2021-04-27 19:26:55.480205;That is a great idea,but I think you'll get sicker if you go.
3;4;2021-04-27 19:28:07.480205;can we go some other time?
3;3;2021-04-27 19:29:13.480205;For sure
3;4;2021-04-27 19:29:24.480205;Sounds like a plan.I'll talk to you later.
3;6;2021-04-27 19:31:05.480205;Cool,see you later.
3;3;2021-04-27 19:32:22.480205;Everything is going wrong today.
3;5;2021-04-27 19:32:39.480205;Well,at least the weather is nice.
3;4;2021-04-27 19:33:56.480205;Yeah,I love when the sun is shining, but itis not too hot.
3;4;2021-04-27 19:35:35.480205;I do,too.
3;5;2021-04-27 19:36:13.480205;This weather is pretty sweet.
3;3;2021-04-27 19:37:17.480205;I guess everything will be okay in the end.
3;6;2021-04-27 19:39:05.480205;So all you needed was some sunshine.
3;4;2021-04-27 19:39:18.480205;Yeah,I guess you were right for once.
3;5;2021-04-27 19:40:11.480205;Hey I'm always right
3;6;2021-04-27 19:41:39.480205;Quick! Get in here and wait out the storm!
3;6;2021-04-27 19:43:21.480205;Oh,my word
3;5;2021-04-27 19:44:30.480205;It is raining cats and dogs out there.
3;5;2021-04-27 19:45:17.480205;More like lions and wolves
3;3;2021-04-27 19:45:27.480205;I was watching the news.
3;4;2021-04-27 19:46:13.480205;What did they say?
3;5;2021-04-27 19:47:41.480205;This is going to be one heck of a storm.
3;4;2021-04-27 19:49:40.480205;Should we be worried?
3;6;2021-04-27 19:51:06.480205;I don't think so.
3;3;2021-04-27 19:52:02.480205;True,Well,thank you for saving me from this storm.
3;5;2021-04-27 19:52:42.480205;No problem.I'm making some tea
3;4;2021-04-27 19:53:25.480205;would you like some?
3;5;2021-04-27 19:54:21.480205;Please,Something warm would be great at the moment!
3;5;2021-04-27 19:55:12.480205;Heard itis supposed to rain.
3;6;2021-04-27 19:56:50.480205;Where did you hear that from?
3;5;2021-04-27 19:58:37.480205;The weatherman said there is a high probability of rain.
3;3;2021-04-27 20:00:05.480205;Since when have you started watching the news?
3;4;2021-04-27 20:00:29.480205;I've always watched the news.
3;5;2021-04-27 20:02:14.480205;What else did they say about the weekend?
3;4;2021-04-27 20:02:35.480205;I think they said it was going to rain throughout the weekend.
3;4;2021-04-27 20:03:24.480205;Throughout the weekend?
3;3;2021-04-27 20:03:47.480205;Don't pull my chain.
3;5;2021-04-27 20:05:30.480205;I'm not.
3;3;2021-04-27 20:07:17.480205;Okay,suit yourself
3;6;2021-04-27 20:09:13.480205;I won't.
3;3;2021-04-27 20:10:37.480205;I'd rather get wet than listen to you.
3;4;2021-04-27 20:12:35.480205;Why don't you ever answer your phone?
3;4;2021-04-27 20:13:26.480205;I'm usually busy.Whatis up?
3;4;2021-04-27 20:14:49.480205;I wanted to see if you were down to kick it.
3;5;2021-04-27 20:16:45.480205;Where do you want to go?
3;3;2021-04-27 20:17:44.480205;Let us go for a drink at the bar where we went last week.
3;5;2021-04-27 20:18:42.480205;Okay,but I only have enough for three beers.
3;5;2021-04-27 20:19:45.480205;It is fine.I'll pay for the rest
3;5;2021-04-27 20:20:07.480205;I paid for you last time.You owe me!
3;4;2021-04-27 20:22:00.480205;Well, then we can call it even.
3;3;2021-04-27 20:22:33.480205;Where should we meet?
3;3;2021-04-27 20:23:49.480205;How about at the train station by the bar?
3;4;2021-04-27 20:25:41.480205;Sounds good.I'll see you in an hour.
3;5;2021-04-27 20:27:30.480205;Great.See you then,later
3;6;2021-04-27 20:28:45.480205;I forgot to tell you,I'm going out with Sarah.
3;6;2021-04-27 20:29:42.480205;Which one is Sarah?
3;5;2021-04-27 20:30:35.480205;You date so many girls that I get confused.
3;6;2021-04-27 20:32:06.480205;First off,I don't date.
3;4;2021-04-27 20:32:58.480205;So,which one is she?
3;4;2021-04-27 20:33:15.480205;Which girl?
3;4;2021-04-27 20:35:07.480205;The cute one.You know the one with the tattoo up her thigh?
3;6;2021-04-27 20:35:43.480205;I think I would have noticed that.
3;6;2021-04-27 20:35:54.480205;She is the only one with blonde hair.
3;3;2021-04-27 20:37:35.480205;Well.
3;4;2021-04-27 20:37:50.480205;I know you check her out,I assumed you saw the tattoo.
3;4;2021-04-27 20:39:23.480205;I'm not that big of a pervert.
3;5;2021-04-27 20:41:22.480205;I have a new co-worker at work,She is pretty.
3;3;2021-04-27 20:42:00.480205;Oh,yeah?
3;4;2021-04-27 20:43:33.480205;Is she prettier than your ex-girlfriend?
3;3;2021-04-27 20:45:30.480205;Yeah,she is.
3;5;2021-04-27 20:46:08.480205;Sheis tall,thin,and wears glasses.
3;5;2021-04-27 20:48:01.480205;What is it with you and girls with glasses?
3;6;2021-04-27 20:49:50.480205;You know what?I don't know.
3;6;2021-04-27 20:50:42.480205;Well,tell me about her.
3;5;2021-04-27 20:50:52.480205;She likes music.She is always wearing band t-shirts.
3;6;2021-04-27 20:52:34.480205;Really? Are they any bands you like?
3;5;2021-04-27 20:54:19.480205;Yeah,actually a lot of them are.
3;6;2021-04-27 20:55:30.480205;How does she act?
3;5;2021-04-27 20:56:22.480205;Is she nice?
3;6;2021-04-27 20:57:36.480205;She is.
3;3;2021-04-27 20:58:19.480205;I dropped my wallet,and didn't notice,She took it to me.
3;3;2021-04-27 20:59:49.480205;Well,ask her out tomorrow,or somebody will.
3;6;2021-04-27 21:00:53.480205;I heard that your brother is in the hospital.
3;5;2021-04-27 21:02:51.480205;Yeah,He is been there since last week.
3;5;2021-04-27 21:04:06.480205;What happened?
3;4;2021-04-27 21:05:06.480205;Is he alright?
3;5;2021-04-27 21:06:13.480205;The doctors told you he would be alright?
3;3;2021-04-27 21:06:27.480205;Yes,but they need to keep him for further tests.
3;5;2021-04-27 21:07:20.480205;Really lucky.Did anyone else get injured?
3;6;2021-04-27 21:08:39.480205;His girlfriend broke her arm,but that is all.
3;5;2021-04-27 21:09:11.480205;Oh,thatis not good.Is she at the hospital?
3;4;2021-04-27 21:09:57.480205;Yes,she is taking care of my brother.
3;6;2021-04-27 21:11:22.480205;C'mon,guess what?
3;6;2021-04-27 21:12:59.480205;I don't know, chicken butt?
3;5;2021-04-27 21:13:14.480205;Stop playing games.I got the part in the school play!
3;4;2021-04-27 21:13:48.480205;Really? Thatis great!
3;6;2021-04-27 21:14:18.480205;All this practice is finally paying off.
3;4;2021-04-27 21:15:18.480205;Yes,it is.I can't believe it!
3;4;2021-04-27 21:16:57.480205;Same here.I'm going to be the main character!
3;5;2021-04-27 21:17:23.480205;I'm so proud of you.I can't wait to see the play.
3;6;2021-04-27 21:19:16.480205;It is going to be a lot of hard work,but I'm glad I got the part.
3;3;2021-04-27 21:20:47.480205;When does the play open?
3;6;2021-04-27 21:21:09.480205;It opens in three weeks.
3;6;2021-04-27 21:23:01.480205;Great.Get me a ticket.I want to be sitting in the front row.
3;4;2021-04-27 21:23:15.480205;That is an awesome shirt.
3;5;2021-04-27 21:23:48.480205;Thank you.It is so nice of you to say.
3;4;2021-04-27 21:25:01.480205;Where did you get it?
3;6;2021-04-27 21:26:45.480205;I got it at a store at the mall.
3;4;2021-04-27 21:28:37.480205;Did it cost a lot?
3;5;2021-04-27 21:28:56.480205;Things are usually overpriced there.
3;3;2021-04-27 21:29:13.480205;Actually,it was quite cheap.I got it for $15.99.
3;6;2021-04-27 21:30:57.480205;That is pretty cheap.
3;4;2021-04-27 21:31:34.480205;Do they have it in other colors?
3;6;2021-04-27 21:31:45.480205;Yes,sure.
3;5;2021-04-27 21:32:43.480205;Would you want to come with me?
3;5;2021-04-27 21:33:34.480205;We can go after school,if you want?
3;4;2021-04-27 21:35:08.480205;Do you want to do something?
3;3;2021-04-27 21:36:45.480205;What did you have in mind?
3;3;2021-04-27 21:38:31.480205;Do you want to go drink?
3;3;2021-04-27 21:39:35.480205;No,I have work tomorrow,and I don't want to be hung over.
3;4;2021-04-27 21:41:02.480205;You don't have to get wasted.
3;4;2021-04-27 21:42:53.480205;I know you.You won't shut your mouth until I get wasted.
3;6;2021-04-27 21:43:34.480205;I'm down to go to the record store.
3;4;2021-04-27 21:44:50.480205;I haven't been there in a while.
3;5;2021-04-27 21:46:25.480205;Well,what do you want to do?
3;6;2021-04-27 21:47:32.480205;Let us go to the movies instead?
3;4;2021-04-27 21:48:33.480205;What is your favorite movie?
3;4;2021-04-27 21:49:32.480205;The Grand Budapest Hotel.Why do you ask?
3;3;2021-04-27 21:51:15.480205;I was wondering what types of movies you liked.
3;6;2021-04-27 21:52:35.480205;Well, that is my favorite movie, but I like all sorts of movies.
3;6;2021-04-27 21:53:30.480205;How many times would you say you have seen it?
3;5;2021-04-27 21:55:09.480205;Too many to say.I watch it at least twice a month.
3;3;2021-04-27 21:57:04.480205;Really,you like it that much?
3;4;2021-04-27 21:58:11.480205;It is a really good movie.You should watch it.
3;5;2021-04-27 21:58:52.480205;Could I borrow it?I don't have money to buy it.
3;4;2021-04-27 22:00:01.480205;Yes,I could lend you the movie,but be careful with it.
3;4;2021-04-27 22:01:19.480205;I don't know which class to register for.
3;4;2021-04-27 22:02:52.480205;You should pick the class you need.
3;6;2021-04-27 22:03:22.480205;I know I need a science class.
3;4;2021-04-27 22:04:16.480205;I would take biology with Mr. Green.
3;4;2021-04-27 22:05:14.480205;Its a challenging yet fun class.
3;6;2021-04-27 22:05:52.480205;I don't like challenges.
3;3;2021-04-27 22:07:43.480205;Why are you in college then?
3;5;2021-04-27 22:09:31.480205;My mom forced me to enroll.
3;3;2021-04-27 22:11:23.480205;You should go to a vocational school instead.
3;6;2021-04-27 22:11:39.480205;I don't think you understand.
3;4;2021-04-27 22:12:44.480205;Okay, fine.I recommend Earth Science 125 with Mr. Anderson.
3;4;2021-04-27 22:14:02.480205;Thanks for the recommendation!
3;4;2021-04-27 22:14:45.480205;I am so upset.
3;3;2021-04-27 22:16:16.480205;Oh,no.Talk to me about it.
3;6;2021-04-27 22:17:48.480205;I can't register for a class I really need.
3;4;2021-04-27 22:19:19.480205;Is it full?
3;4;2021-04-27 22:20:25.480205;I have a hold on my record, because my library books were overdue.
3;3;2021-04-27 22:22:09.480205;Can't you just pay the overdue fees?
3;3;2021-04-27 22:22:22.480205;I can't afford it.I'm totally broke.
3;5;2021-04-27 22:24:06.480205;How much do you need?
3;6;2021-04-27 22:25:57.480205;I need $50.
3;3;2021-04-27 22:26:43.480205;Wow, you must have kept those books long past the due date.
3;4;2021-04-27 22:28:24.480205;Yes,I know I am horrible.
3;3;2021-04-27 22:29:06.480205;I'll lend you the money.
3;4;2021-04-27 22:30:46.480205;Hi,I'm James.What is your name?
3;6;2021-04-27 22:32:29.480205;Hi James. My name is Lisa.
3;4;2021-04-27 22:32:59.480205;I'm taking this class because it seems interesting.Why are you?
3;6;2021-04-27 22:33:25.480205;I'm taking this class because it is a requirement.
3;5;2021-04-27 22:34:18.480205;We should get to know each other.
3;5;2021-04-27 22:35:50.480205;I don't think so.I like keeping to myself.
3;3;2021-04-27 22:36:47.480205;So you don't like meeting new students?
3;4;2021-04-27 22:37:32.480205;Nope,I would rather just be alone.
3;3;2021-04-27 22:38:25.480205;That is so sad!It is not.
3;4;2021-04-27 22:39:01.480205;It is really peaceful and self-empowering.
3;4;2021-04-27 22:40:42.480205;Can we at least study together?
3;4;2021-04-27 22:42:28.480205;Nope,we can't do that.
3;4;2021-04-27 22:43:52.480205;It takes me hours to find my classroom.
3;4;2021-04-27 22:45:36.480205;I might be able to help you.
3;6;2021-04-27 22:46:40.480205;Really?That would be great!
3;6;2021-04-27 22:48:38.480205;What is your classroom number?
3;5;2021-04-27 22:50:07.480205;My classroom number is A21.
3;5;2021-04-27 22:50:32.480205;So the A is the building type.
3;6;2021-04-27 22:52:08.480205;Okay,but I don't know where that is.
3;4;2021-04-27 22:53:40.480205;Do you know where the gym is?
3;3;2021-04-27 22:55:30.480205;Yeah,I do.
3;5;2021-04-27 22:57:12.480205;Okay,your classroom is behind the gym.
3;3;2021-04-27 22:58:23.480205;That is really helpful!Thank you.
3;4;2021-04-27 23:00:08.480205;No problem,and the 21 means it is upstairs
3;5;2021-04-27 23:00:20.480205;I can't spend anymore money after I buy my English textbook.
3;3;2021-04-27 23:00:50.480205;How much is your English textbook?
3;4;2021-04-27 23:02:47.480205;It is $198.I'm not kidding.
3;6;2021-04-27 23:03:06.480205;That is ridiculously expensive!What is the title of the textbook?
3;5;2021-04-27 23:04:23.480205;It is called How to Write Well.
3;3;2021-04-27 23:05:46.480205;Dude, someone is selling that book for $30.
3;3;2021-04-27 23:07:17.480205;No way.What edition is it?
3;3;2021-04-27 23:07:54.480205;I think it was the 10th edition.
3;5;2021-04-27 23:08:31.480205;Oh,no wonder he or she is selling it for only $30.
3;6;2021-04-27 23:08:48.480205;What edition do you need?
3;5;2021-04-27 23:09:35.480205;I need the 21st edition.
3;3;2021-04-27 23:10:03.480205;The publisher seems to be really making money,considering the number of editions.
3;5;2021-04-27 23:11:46.480205;I hate Professor Hernandez!
3;3;2021-04-27 23:12:12.480205;Me too! He keeps calling me stupid!
3;4;2021-04-27 23:13:21.480205;You think that is bad? He gave me an F,because I double spaced my essay!
3;4;2021-04-27 23:14:30.480205;But every professor wants essays double spaced.He is crazy!
3;6;2021-04-27 23:15:23.480205;Professor Hernandez is weird.He wants essays triple spaced.
3;5;2021-04-27 23:16:49.480205;That is just a waste of paper.Why does he like triple spacing?
3;3;2021-04-27 23:17:02.480205;He says it is because he has to make a lot of corrections,because we're stupid.
3;4;2021-04-27 23:19:00.480205;We should start a petition, and get him fired!
3;6;2021-04-27 23:20:06.480205;We should,but he can find out.
3;5;2021-04-27 23:21:41.480205;I know.If he found out,he would ruin everyone is life.
3;3;2021-04-27 23:21:59.480205;He is so evil.
3;4;2021-04-27 23:22:24.480205;That is why this petition has to work
3;4;2021-04-27 23:22:49.480205;Hey,Professor Hill.
3;3;2021-04-27 23:24:10.480205;What is it?
3;6;2021-04-27 23:24:52.480205;I've been having trouble with derivatives.
3;6;2021-04-27 23:25:49.480205;That is not good.There is a test on derivatives next week.
3;4;2021-04-27 23:27:03.480205;Can I make an appointment with you for some help?
3;6;2021-04-27 23:28:17.480205;I'm a busy man.
3;5;2021-04-27 23:28:55.480205;You didn't even check your schedule yet!
3;6;2021-04-27 23:30:41.480205;I know I'm busy,because many people already made appointments.
3;4;2021-04-27 23:31:23.480205;So I'm hopeless?
3;4;2021-04-27 23:33:08.480205;Of course not!There is the tutoring center.
3;4;2021-04-27 23:34:23.480205;But the tutors are not professors.They're just students.
3;3;2021-04-27 23:35:23.480205;They might surprise you
3;5;2021-04-27 23:36:13.480205;May I turn in my homework tomorrow?
3;5;2021-04-27 23:37:45.480205;It is due today.
3;5;2021-04-27 23:39:05.480205;I know,but I don't have it right now.
3;4;2021-04-27 23:39:59.480205;How come?
3;6;2021-04-27 23:40:15.480205;No!I left it at home.
3;6;2021-04-27 23:40:28.480205;I can't take your word for it.
3;5;2021-04-27 23:42:24.480205;Why not?I'm an A+ student.
3;6;2021-04-27 23:43:37.480205;How do I know if you even did the homework?
3;5;2021-04-27 23:44:51.480205;I'll ask my mom to take a picture of it and send it to me.
3;5;2021-04-27 23:46:42.480205;That is fair enough.
3;6;2021-04-27 23:47:05.480205;Thanks,Also,you should try trusting students more. We're not all that bad.
3;3;2021-04-27 23:47:58.480205;I'll try,but I can't promise anything.
3;4;2021-04-27 23:48:58.480205;I have to tell you something.
3;6;2021-04-27 23:49:10.480205;What is it?
3;4;2021-04-27 23:49:39.480205;You graded my test incorrectly.I got this wrong,but you didn't mark it.
3;3;2021-04-27 23:51:31.480205;Wow!I have never met a more honest student.
3;3;2021-04-27 23:52:15.480205;I just felt wrong.
3;4;2021-04-27 23:54:11.480205;Just keep the score you have.
3;6;2021-04-27 23:55:35.480205;Really?That is awesome.
3;5;2021-04-27 23:57:20.480205;Yes,I have to ask,why did you decide to tell me?
3;4;2021-04-27 23:57:44.480205;I'm really bad at lying.
3;5;2021-04-27 23:58:03.480205;That is a good thing!Your honesty is praiseworthy.
3;5;2021-04-27 23:58:34.480205;Thanks,Want to give me extra credit?
3;5;2021-04-27 23:59:14.480205;Don't push it.
3;3;2021-04-27 23:59:33.480205;Can I borrow your class notes from yesterday is lecture?
3;5;2021-04-27 23:59:56.480205;You're so lazy.
3;6;2021-04-28 00:00:17.480205;What are you talking about? I was sick yesterday.
3;6;2021-04-28 00:00:37.480205;I don't care.
3;3;2021-04-28 00:01:09.480205;You're so mean!
3;6;2021-04-28 00:02:11.480205;I can't let anyone borrow my class notes.
3;3;2021-04-28 00:02:33.480205;Why not?They're just notes.
3;6;2021-04-28 00:02:48.480205;I let a classmate borrow my notes once,and she sold copies to people.
3;5;2021-04-28 00:04:00.480205;That is crazy,For how much?
3;4;2021-04-28 00:04:54.480205;She sold each class note set for $5.
3;4;2021-04-28 00:05:51.480205;Don't worry,I promise not to sell your notes.
3;3;2021-04-28 00:06:31.480205;I can't take your word for it
3;3;2021-04-28 00:06:45.480205;I think your grading policy is unfair.
3;6;2021-04-28 00:07:16.480205;I beg your pardon?!
3;6;2021-04-28 00:08:39.480205;Why is a 90% a B?
3;4;2021-04-28 00:08:51.480205;I'm trying to challenge you guys.
3;4;2021-04-28 00:09:51.480205;That is not a challenge,that is a punishment.
3;3;2021-04-28 00:11:41.480205;I've had this policy since I started teaching.
3;3;2021-04-28 00:13:18.480205;It is time for a change.
3;4;2021-04-28 00:13:47.480205;I'm not changing my policy because you don't like it.
3;3;2021-04-28 00:14:28.480205;Put yourself in my shoes.
3;3;2021-04-28 00:15:56.480205;I have been a student once,and I think my policy is fair.
3;4;2021-04-28 00:16:31.480205;I'm going to drop your class
3;6;2021-04-28 00:16:42.480205;Go ahead!Less for me to grade!
3;6;2021-04-28 00:17:34.480205;I have a 89.5%.
3;4;2021-04-28 00:17:54.480205;Okay,so what?
3;4;2021-04-28 00:19:18.480205;It is really close to an A.
3;3;2021-04-28 00:19:52.480205;You know I don't round up.
3;5;2021-04-28 00:21:28.480205;But I really need a 4.0 GPA.
3;3;2021-04-28 00:22:52.480205;You get what you deserve.
3;5;2021-04-28 00:24:00.480205;I know I deserve an A,I always do great work and participate.
3;4;2021-04-28 00:25:50.480205;I can't change it.
3;6;2021-04-28 00:27:30.480205;Please? I'll wash your car.
3;3;2021-04-28 00:28:33.480205;Are you bribing me?
3;6;2021-04-28 00:29:49.480205;I just want an A.
3;3;2021-04-28 00:30:44.480205;I'll give you a C if you don't leave now.
3;3;2021-04-28 00:31:26.480205;Why were you absent yesterday?
3;6;2021-04-28 00:33:11.480205;Why do you care?
3;5;2021-04-28 00:34:40.480205;You should be thankful I care so much about your education.
3;4;2021-04-28 00:35:45.480205;The truth is,I didn't hear the alarm clock.
3;4;2021-04-28 00:36:52.480205;You missed out on a very important lecture.
3;5;2021-04-28 00:38:17.480205;It happens. I'll just ask my friend what was on the lecture.
3;6;2021-04-28 00:39:08.480205;Is she a good note taker?
3;6;2021-04-28 00:39:24.480205;I don't know.I guess?
3;3;2021-04-28 00:40:55.480205;If you were in class,you wouldn't have to rely on anyone is notes.
3;3;2021-04-28 00:42:39.480205;I can't change the past.
3;4;2021-04-28 00:43:41.480205;I know,Anyways,you should increase the volume on your alarm clock.
3;6;2021-04-28 00:45:34.480205;I suppose I could do that.
3;4;2021-04-28 00:46:19.480205;I have to leave class early tomorrow.
3;5;2021-04-28 00:47:51.480205;I don't like that.Just don't come to class.
3;6;2021-04-28 00:48:47.480205;Don't be like that,Professor I have to attend my moms funeral.
3;3;2021-04-28 00:50:25.480205;I'm sorry for your loss.
3;5;2021-04-28 00:51:35.480205;It is okay.I'm going to miss her.
3;5;2021-04-28 00:53:32.480205;I lost my mom when I was in college, too.
3;3;2021-04-28 00:54:36.480205;Saddest thing ever,right?
3;3;2021-04-28 00:55:00.480205;Yes.You know what?Take a week off school.
3;6;2021-04-28 00:56:49.480205;I can't do that.I have too many responsibilities.
3;4;2021-04-28 00:57:42.480205;Take my advice.
3;3;2021-04-28 00:58:21.480205;I'll think about it.
3;4;2021-04-28 00:58:45.480205;If you ever need to talk,my door is open.
3;6;2021-04-28 00:59:28.480205;I would like to see my counselor now.
3;3;2021-04-28 00:59:45.480205;Sorry,she doesn't have any time today.
3;4;2021-04-28 01:01:38.480205;Are you serious?
3;3;2021-04-28 01:02:13.480205;Yes,I am,Please make an appointment for next week.
3;5;2021-04-28 01:02:49.480205;I really need to see her.
3;4;2021-04-28 01:03:03.480205;I'm sorry,but you really can't.
3;4;2021-04-28 01:05:01.480205;I swear,I will bang on her door and scream.
3;5;2021-04-28 01:06:25.480205;Don't make a scene.
3;3;2021-04-28 01:06:41.480205;If you don't want me to make a scene,tell the counselor I'm here.
3;6;2021-04-28 01:08:15.480205;Fine!You can only talk to her for five minutes,though.
3;3;2021-04-28 01:10:14.480205;That is all I need.
3;4;2021-04-28 01:11:21.480205;Next time,you'd better make an appointment.
3;6;2021-04-28 01:12:28.480205;I'm glad you came to talk to me today.
3;6;2021-04-28 01:13:54.480205;You kind of forced me to.
3;4;2021-04-28 01:14:35.480205;That is because I'm worried.
3;3;2021-04-28 01:15:34.480205;What are you worried about?
3;6;2021-04-28 01:17:02.480205;You withdrew from 4 of your 5 classes last semester.
3;4;2021-04-28 01:17:30.480205;I was doing poorly!
3;6;2021-04-28 01:18:02.480205;And why was that exactly?
3;4;2021-04-28 01:18:53.480205;It was just too hard.
3;5;2021-04-28 01:20:51.480205;You're really behind now.You might have to spend 6 years here.
3;6;2021-04-28 01:21:36.480205;Can't I just take summer classes?
3;4;2021-04-28 01:22:07.480205;Yes,but you don't want to stress yourself out.
3;5;2021-04-28 01:22:22.480205;I don't really have a choice.
3;4;2021-04-28 01:23:37.480205;I'm thinking of adding another class.
3;3;2021-04-28 01:24:10.480205;Another one?You already have 7 classes.
3;3;2021-04-28 01:25:47.480205;I know,but I really want to add Psychology 101,It seems interesting.
3;4;2021-04-28 01:26:08.480205;You're going to be so stressed out.
3;6;2021-04-28 01:27:20.480205;I think I can handle 8 classes.
3;3;2021-04-28 01:27:50.480205;Seriously?You're going to be constantly in class or studying.
3;5;2021-04-28 01:28:53.480205;I know,but it is worth it.
3;5;2021-04-28 01:29:42.480205;Tell me that when I'm partying and you're not.
3;6;2021-04-28 01:31:25.480205;How many classes are you taking?Two?
3;5;2021-04-28 01:32:57.480205;Haha!You're funny.I'm taking three.
3;6;2021-04-28 01:34:37.480205;That is so little.Don't you feel like an underachiever?
3;3;2021-04-28 01:35:57.480205;Remind me again why we're friends.
3;3;2021-04-28 01:36:26.480205;Want to go to the writing workshop with me today?
3;4;2021-04-28 01:38:06.480205;Nah man,my writing skills is tight.
3;5;2021-04-28 01:39:23.480205;You mean "are" instead of "is,"right?
3;3;2021-04-28 01:41:09.480205;Yeah,of course!
3;5;2021-04-28 01:42:07.480205;You should come with me.Our college has great workshops.
3;6;2021-04-28 01:42:38.480205;I don't want to look stupid.
3;6;2021-04-28 01:43:31.480205;You won't.You look stupid using incorrect grammar.
3;6;2021-04-28 01:43:41.480205;Fine.How long is the workshop?
3;3;2021-04-28 01:45:07.480205;It is about an hour.
3;3;2021-04-28 01:45:21.480205;I don't think my attention span is more than 5 minutes.
3;4;2021-04-28 01:47:14.480205;Don't worry,I'll pinch you to wake you up.
3;6;2021-04-28 01:48:49.480205;That is a clever idea.
3;5;2021-04-28 01:50:22.480205;I'm planning to study abroad this summer.
3;5;2021-04-28 01:50:35.480205;Cool!Where are you going?
3;5;2021-04-28 01:51:48.480205;I'm going to Italy.
3;5;2021-04-28 01:52:25.480205;What are you doing there?
3;5;2021-04-28 01:53:53.480205;I'm taking a cooking class.
3;6;2021-04-28 01:54:48.480205;That sounds interesting.
3;4;2021-04-28 01:56:46.480205;I'm excited to learn in a totally new environment.
3;3;2021-04-28 01:57:14.480205;Italy seems beautiful.
3;6;2021-04-28 01:58:43.480205;It is beautiful in the pictures I've seen.
3;5;2021-04-28 02:00:03.480205;Take a lot when you're there.
3;4;2021-04-28 02:00:21.480205;I will,and I'll study hard, too.
3;5;2021-04-28 02:00:31.480205;Also,learn some Italian while you're there.
3;6;2021-04-28 02:01:15.480205;I hope I can find a job after graduation.
3;4;2021-04-28 02:02:27.480205;What is your major?
3;6;2021-04-28 02:02:48.480205;My major is geology.
3;5;2021-04-28 02:04:22.480205;Geology majors aren't very high in demand,but you'll do fine.
3;5;2021-04-28 02:05:52.480205;What makes you say that?
3;3;2021-04-28 02:06:08.480205;You're smart and likeable.Don't worry.
3;4;2021-04-28 02:07:03.480205;Thanks,but I'm still scared.
3;3;2021-04-28 02:07:23.480205;Oh,hey!You should go to the job fair.
3;3;2021-04-28 02:08:59.480205;We have that here?
3;4;2021-04-28 02:09:43.480205;Yes.Take advantage of it.
3;6;2021-04-28 02:11:35.480205;Have you ever been there?
3;6;2021-04-28 02:13:21.480205;Yes,and it is really helpful.Dress nicely!
3;4;2021-04-28 02:13:32.480205;I am so sick of dining hall food.
3;5;2021-04-28 02:14:24.480205;Me too!It is so unhealthy.
3;5;2021-04-28 02:15:09.480205;We should go to a restaurant nearby.
3;5;2021-04-28 02:16:46.480205;Want to go to Health Nut?
3;6;2021-04-28 02:17:19.480205;What a funny name!
3;5;2021-04-28 02:18:54.480205;I like it!
3;4;2021-04-28 02:20:27.480205;Do they sell nuts?
3;5;2021-04-28 02:20:56.480205;I'm not sure.Anyways,I want to try their organic tofu.
3;3;2021-04-28 02:22:49.480205;I'm allergic to tofu.
3;3;2021-04-28 02:23:36.480205;That is okay!They serve a wide variety of food.
3;6;2021-04-28 02:24:37.480205;Great!I'm just glad we're not eating dining hall food.
3;6;2021-04-28 02:26:08.480205;Me too.Let us go!
3;3;2021-04-28 02:26:24.480205;Why are you taking so long?Is something wrong?
3;3;2021-04-28 02:27:09.480205;Sorry,my bag of chips got stuck.
3;4;2021-04-28 02:28:18.480205;Vending machines suck,huh?
3;3;2021-04-28 02:29:46.480205;They're the worst,but the food is great.
3;5;2021-04-28 02:30:08.480205;It might come out if someone buys an item from the same column yours is on.
3;5;2021-04-28 02:31:28.480205;Can you be that someone?
3;3;2021-04-28 02:31:57.480205;Sure,why not?I could use some chips.
3;5;2021-04-28 02:33:16.480205;Thanks!Hey,what is your name?
3;3;2021-04-28 02:34:27.480205;My name is Charlie.
3;4;2021-04-28 02:35:52.480205;Nice to meet you,Charlie.
3;4;2021-04-28 02:36:04.480205;What is your name?
3;3;2021-04-28 02:37:16.480205;Hater of Vending Machines.
3;5;2021-04-28 02:39:08.480205;I would like to purchase the book for Sociology
3;4;2021-04-28 02:40:36.480205;May I see your student ID?
3;3;2021-04-28 02:40:55.480205;I didn't know we needed it.
3;3;2021-04-28 02:42:34.480205;Please go get your ID,and get in line again.
3;6;2021-04-28 02:44:31.480205;But I waited in line for two hours!
3;3;2021-04-28 02:45:32.480205;I'm sorry,but you need a student ID to purchase textbooks here.
3;4;2021-04-28 02:45:55.480205;Are there any other options?
3;3;2021-04-28 02:46:47.480205;Show me proof that you're a student at this college,and you'll be good.
3;5;2021-04-28 02:47:15.480205;I have my report card.Here it is.
3;5;2021-04-28 02:48:25.480205;This will do.Nice grades by the way.
3;4;2021-04-28 02:48:43.480205;Thanks!I worked very hard for them.
3;4;2021-04-28 02:50:19.480205;Good luck with this semester.
3;4;2021-04-28 02:51:23.480205;Wow!Your books are over the due date by one month.
3;6;2021-04-28 02:53:19.480205;It would have been longer if there wasn't a hold on my record.
3;3;2021-04-28 02:54:36.480205;What kind of hold is on your record?
3;5;2021-04-28 02:55:19.480205;A hold that won't let me go to the college football game.
3;6;2021-04-28 02:56:04.480205;Oh,that is tough.
3;4;2021-04-28 02:56:46.480205;Yeah.My girlfriend is actually a cheerleader and so I have to go.
3;4;2021-04-28 02:57:23.480205;You're not going to like what I'm going to say.
3;4;2021-04-28 02:58:59.480205;What is it?
3;5;2021-04-28 03:00:52.480205;I can't remove the hold even if you pay the overdue fee.
3;4;2021-04-28 03:02:14.480205;Is it a technical error?
3;4;2021-04-28 03:02:53.480205;I don't know!I just can't remove it!
3;4;2021-04-28 03:04:00.480205;If my girlfriend breaks up with me,I'm blaming you
3;6;2021-04-28 03:05:35.480205;What do you plan to do after you graduate from here?
3;4;2021-04-28 03:06:51.480205;I'm planning to go to medical school,You?
3;4;2021-04-28 03:07:58.480205;I'm planning to teach English in underprivileged countries.
3;5;2021-04-28 03:08:46.480205;That is really kind of you.
3;6;2021-04-28 03:09:41.480205;Thanks,The first country I'm teaching in is Kenya.
3;4;2021-04-28 03:11:19.480205;While you're at Kenya,I'll be studying for medical school.
3;5;2021-04-28 03:11:58.480205;What kind of doctor do you want to be?
3;5;2021-04-28 03:13:34.480205;I want to be a pediatrician.
3;5;2021-04-28 03:15:10.480205;Because you like kids?
3;5;2021-04-28 03:17:01.480205;I don't really have a good reason.I just think I'll be good at it.
3;5;2021-04-28 03:17:21.480205;You should do what you love,not necessarily what you're good at.
3;6;2021-04-28 03:19:05.480205;That is very cheesy advice.
3;5;2021-04-28 03:20:42.480205;The parking permit is $200 per semester,right?
3;6;2021-04-28 03:21:19.480205;It is actually $300.
3;5;2021-04-28 03:21:53.480205;Why?!That is ridiculous.
3;6;2021-04-28 03:22:45.480205;It is because of the budget cuts.
3;3;2021-04-28 03:24:01.480205;That is a terrible excuse.
3;6;2021-04-28 03:25:56.480205;It is the truth.
3;6;2021-04-28 03:26:52.480205;Give me something better than that.
3;6;2021-04-28 03:27:28.480205;Miss,if you don't want to pay,then don't.
3;5;2021-04-28 03:28:01.480205;This is so stressful.
3;4;2021-04-28 03:29:10.480205;I advise writing a letter to the dean.
3;5;2021-04-28 03:30:48.480205;I bet he'll just throw it away.
3;6;2021-04-28 03:31:23.480205;You would be surprised.
3;6;2021-04-28 03:33:13.480205;Do you have a car on campus?
3;5;2021-04-28 03:35:00.480205;No,because it is hard to find parking here.
3;3;2021-04-28 03:36:23.480205;How do you get to places then?
3;6;2021-04-28 03:38:16.480205;I walk or take the bus.
3;6;2021-04-28 03:38:29.480205;That is crazy!I could never do that.
3;6;2021-04-28 03:39:12.480205;You should.It is great for the environment.
3;4;2021-04-28 03:40:06.480205;That is true.What do you do for fun then?
3;4;2021-04-28 03:41:24.480205;There is a lot of stuff to do around campus.
3;6;2021-04-28 03:42:17.480205;I never realized.
3;6;2021-04-28 03:43:58.480205;You should do some exploring.
3;4;2021-04-28 03:44:48.480205;You convinced me.I won't bring my car this semester.
3;6;2021-04-28 03:45:38.480205;We can walk to places together now!
3;3;2021-04-28 03:46:59.480205;You know you can't park here,right?
3;4;2021-04-28 03:48:52.480205;Listen,I had to talk to my friend really quickly and there was no parking spaces.
3;3;2021-04-28 03:50:11.480205;I'm going to have to give you a ticket.
3;5;2021-04-28 03:50:52.480205;I'm a broke college student.
3;3;2021-04-28 03:51:12.480205;And I'm a broke police officer.Deal with it.
3;4;2021-04-28 03:51:58.480205;Can't you just let me off with a warning?
3;5;2021-04-28 03:53:21.480205;No way.I have to be firm with you.
3;5;2021-04-28 03:54:03.480205;I'll buy you a box of donuts.
3;5;2021-04-28 03:55:07.480205;You have got to be kidding me.
3;6;2021-04-28 03:56:29.480205;I thought all cops liked donuts.
3;5;2021-04-28 03:57:26.480205;That is a stereotype.You should really learn to be quiet.
3;3;2021-04-28 03:58:43.480205;I'll stay quiet if you let me off with a warning.
3;5;2021-04-28 03:59:51.480205;I'm thinking of joining a sports club on campus.
3;3;2021-04-28 04:00:39.480205;You should!It takes away the stress of studying.
3;6;2021-04-28 04:01:44.480205;What sport do you play?
3;4;2021-04-28 04:03:06.480205;I actually play on our university is baseball team.
3;5;2021-04-28 04:03:19.480205;That is cool!You must be really good.
3;6;2021-04-28 04:04:11.480205;Yeah,I have a baseball scholarship.
3;5;2021-04-28 04:04:53.480205;No wonder you're in such great shape!
3;4;2021-04-28 04:06:04.480205;You'll be in great shape too after joining a sports club.
3;4;2021-04-28 04:06:37.480205;I'm thinking of joining the tennis club.
3;6;2021-04-28 04:07:31.480205;I wouldn't if I were you.The members don't even play tennis.
3;6;2021-04-28 04:09:00.480205;What do they do then?
3;5;2021-04-28 04:09:50.480205;They just talk about tennis.They never even touched a racket,though.
3;6;2021-04-28 04:10:04.480205;College is so boring.All I do is go to class.
3;3;2021-04-28 04:11:45.480205;You should join some clubs.
3;4;2021-04-28 04:12:26.480205;Are you a part of any clubs?
3;4;2021-04-28 04:14:12.480205;Yes!I am currently in the Animal Lovers Club and the Knitting Club.
3;5;2021-04-28 04:15:46.480205;What do you do in the Animal Lovers Club?
3;6;2021-04-28 04:16:05.480205;We do a lot of things!Last week,we walked dogs.
3;4;2021-04-28 04:16:50.480205;That sounds fun,What is the wildest animal you ever interacted with?
3;5;2021-04-28 04:17:18.480205;I touched a dodo bird a couple weeks ago.
3;4;2021-04-28 04:18:55.480205;Dodo birds are extinct.
3;5;2021-04-28 04:20:18.480205;I'm just messing with you!
3;3;2021-04-28 04:20:44.480205;You're silly!Okay,I'll join the Animal Lovers Club.
3;3;2021-04-28 04:21:17.480205;Great!We always welcome new members.
3;5;2021-04-28 04:23:13.480205;I have to go to bed early.
3;4;2021-04-28 04:24:55.480205;Why?The night is still young!
3;6;2021-04-28 04:26:10.480205;I have a class at 7 a.m.
3;5;2021-04-28 04:27:52.480205;That is tough!My earliest class is at 9 a.m.
3;5;2021-04-28 04:28:18.480205;That sounds amazing to me.
3;4;2021-04-28 04:30:14.480205;How do you stay awake in that class?
3;4;2021-04-28 04:30:50.480205;Before I go to class,I drink four cups of coffee and take a cold shower.
3;4;2021-04-28 04:31:13.480205;Interesting routine.Does it work?
3;6;2021-04-28 04:31:47.480205;Kind of.It is better than not doing it at all.
3;5;2021-04-28 04:33:35.480205;Why are you taking that class?
3;4;2021-04-28 04:34:59.480205;It is only offered once a year,so I have to take it now.
3;6;2021-04-28 04:36:08.480205;I hope the class is interesting,at least.
3;3;2021-04-28 04:37:50.480205;I hate my roommate.
3;6;2021-04-28 04:38:31.480205;I'm sorry to hear that.What is wrong with her?
3;4;2021-04-28 04:40:12.480205;A lot of things.First of all,she snores so loudly!
3;6;2021-04-28 04:40:35.480205;That is not really her fault.What else?
3;5;2021-04-28 04:41:33.480205;She never takes a shower.
3;3;2021-04-28 04:42:09.480205;That is disgusting!You should tell her to take a shower.
3;5;2021-04-28 04:44:08.480205;I did!She got mad at me and then proceeded to slap me.
3;3;2021-04-28 04:44:36.480205;Ouch!Did you try to get a new roommate?
3;6;2021-04-28 04:46:04.480205;I tried,but I could not.No one was willing to switch.
3;5;2021-04-28 04:46:55.480205;I guess you can get a new room by yourself.
3;3;2021-04-28 04:47:47.480205;Are you okay?You look really sad.
3;5;2021-04-28 04:49:45.480205;I'm homesick,I feel so out of place here.
3;6;2021-04-28 04:50:18.480205;But this college is so awesome?
3;6;2021-04-28 04:52:14.480205;I know,but I really miss home.
3;5;2021-04-28 04:52:46.480205;How far do you live?
3;4;2021-04-28 04:54:21.480205;Far.Let is just say I need an airplane to get there.
3;4;2021-04-28 04:55:22.480205;It is almost winter break.Hang in there?
3;6;2021-04-28 04:55:35.480205;I don't think I can handle it anymore.
3;3;2021-04-28 04:57:13.480205;Don't you want to stop feeling sad?
3;6;2021-04-28 04:58:19.480205;Okay,I'll call them now.
3;6;2021-04-28 04:59:27.480205;could I change my major from biology to political science?
3;5;2021-04-28 05:00:45.480205;Those majors are very different from each other.
3;5;2021-04-28 05:02:12.480205;can't I see myself studying it anymore?
3;4;2021-04-28 05:03:13.480205;You can change it,but you'll have to take more classes.
3;6;2021-04-28 05:03:56.480205;I don't mind.Political science is really interesting to me.
3;5;2021-04-28 05:05:11.480205;You would be graduating a year late?
3;6;2021-04-28 05:07:10.480205;Oh,no.I have to think a little more about this then.
3;5;2021-04-28 05:08:47.480205;I think you should change it,since you hate biology.
3;6;2021-04-28 05:09:08.480205;Are you making the right choice?
3;5;2021-04-28 05:10:25.480205;I have decided to drop out of college.
3;3;2021-04-28 05:12:12.480205;Are you making the worst decision of your life?
3;3;2021-04-28 05:14:06.480205;I just don't get the point of college.It is just memorizing.
3;3;2021-04-28 05:15:02.480205;What are you going to do then?
3;5;2021-04-28 05:16:03.480205;I'm going to get a job!
3;3;2021-04-28 05:16:48.480205;As what?A burger flipper?
3;5;2021-04-28 05:18:29.480205;Don't be mean.I'm going to be rich and successful when I'm older.
3;3;2021-04-28 05:20:13.480205;is it almost impossible to be rich and successful without a college degree?
3;6;2021-04-28 05:20:31.480205;Look at Steve Jobs!He dropped out of college.
3;3;2021-04-28 05:21:55.480205;is he a rare case?
3;4;2021-04-28 05:23:32.480205;Watch me prove you wrong.
3;5;2021-04-28 05:24:42.480205;What is that exactly?
3;4;2021-04-28 05:26:27.480205;It is an expression to refer to the observation that many college freshmen gain weight.
3;4;2021-04-28 05:26:44.480205;Do I have time?
3;3;2021-04-28 05:28:07.480205;You just have to make time.
3;6;2021-04-28 05:29:28.480205;Did you gain any weight?
3;4;2021-04-28 05:30:01.480205;Yeah,I just wear big clothes to hide my fat.
3;3;2021-04-28 05:32:00.480205;Hi,I'm here to apply for a library card.
3;3;2021-04-28 05:32:21.480205;Is this your first time applying for one?
3;3;2021-04-28 05:33:08.480205;It is my first time applying for a card here.
3;5;2021-04-28 05:34:31.480205;Do you have cards with any other libraries?
3;5;2021-04-28 05:35:55.480205;Yes,I have one with my college and one with my local library.
3;5;2021-04-28 05:36:13.480205;What college do you go to?
3;6;2021-04-28 05:37:01.480205;What do you like about it?
3;5;2021-04-28 05:37:55.480205;I like the foreign language books.That is rare for any library.
3;3;2021-04-28 05:38:21.480205;Yes,it is!We get people all over the world because of that section.
3;5;2021-04-28 05:38:31.480205;I really need a book,but I didn't see it on the shelf.
3;4;2021-04-28 05:39:37.480205;So someone else has the book and plans on checking it out?
3;6;2021-04-28 05:40:08.480205;Either that or someone took it out of the shelf and misplaced it.
3;5;2021-04-28 05:40:45.480205;I really need that book.
3;5;2021-04-28 05:42:33.480205;You're going to have to look everywhere for it.
3;3;2021-04-28 05:44:09.480205;Can't you just make an announcement asking whoever has the book to come forward?
3;6;2021-04-28 05:45:39.480205;You are not that special.
3;5;2021-04-28 05:47:05.480205;can you help me find a book on tigers?
3;4;2021-04-28 05:47:30.480205;Yes,of course.
3;3;2021-04-28 05:48:30.480205;Is it for a school project?
3;6;2021-04-28 05:49:19.480205;Yes,I'm doing an essay on the life of a tiger.
3;4;2021-04-28 05:50:51.480205;You're going to want one with a lot of words and less pictures
3;3;2021-04-28 05:51:04.480205;yes,ofcourse.
3;4;2021-04-28 05:51:40.480205;Fine,I admit you're right.
3;6;2021-04-28 05:53:19.480205;You can borrow the book with pictures for your own pleasure
3;4;2021-04-28 05:55:10.480205;Great!You're so helpful.
3;4;2021-04-28 05:55:28.480205;It is my job to be helpful.
3;5;2021-04-28 05:56:49.480205;I would like to reserve The Hunger Games. 
3;5;2021-04-28 05:58:17.480205;Everyone wants to reserve that book these days.
3;5;2021-04-28 05:58:45.480205;It is really popular,because the movie just came out.
3;4;2021-04-28 06:00:32.480205;You have to pay $1 to reserve the book.
3;5;2021-04-28 06:01:13.480205;What?!That is ridiculous.
3;3;2021-04-28 06:01:39.480205;Like you said,it is popular.
3;5;2021-04-28 06:02:39.480205;How much is the book?
3;4;2021-04-28 06:03:14.480205;On the back,it says it is $15,It depends on the bookstore you go to though.
3;5;2021-04-28 06:03:33.480205;Fine,I'll give you a $1.
3;5;2021-04-28 06:03:59.480205;You won't regret it!The book is really good.
3;3;2021-04-28 06:04:35.480205;I'm sorry,but you can't borrow this book.
3;6;2021-04-28 06:06:07.480205;What do you mean?
3;3;2021-04-28 06:07:48.480205;You have not paid your late fees for your overdue books.
3;6;2021-04-28 06:09:14.480205;I never had any overdue books!
3;4;2021-04-28 06:10:55.480205;The computer doesn't lie.
3;3;2021-04-28 06:11:24.480205;What books do I have late fees for?
3;6;2021-04-28 06:11:52.480205;They're all math books,and according to the system, you still have them.
3;4;2021-04-28 06:12:30.480205;Oh yeah,I do!I totally forgot about them and left them on my bed.
3;6;2021-04-28 06:13:56.480205;Once you return them and pay the fee,you can borrow books again.
3;6;2021-04-28 06:14:36.480205;But I really need to borrow those books now.
3;5;2021-04-28 06:16:27.480205;I can put them on hold for you.
3;6;2021-04-28 06:16:46.480205;Yes!You are the best.
3;5;2021-04-28 06:18:27.480205;I'm so frustrated,I can't find any books on my research topic at my library.
3;4;2021-04-28 06:18:45.480205;Why don't you try a different library?
3;5;2021-04-28 06:18:58.480205;I don't want to waste gas money.
3;5;2021-04-28 06:20:10.480205;But you might find your book.
3;6;2021-04-28 06:20:59.480205;What library do you suggest?
3;4;2021-04-28 06:21:09.480205;I suggest the one near my house.
3;5;2021-04-28 06:21:46.480205;That is way too far for me.
3;3;2021-04-28 06:23:42.480205;They have a lot of books.That library has never disappointed me.
3;6;2021-04-28 06:25:31.480205;Why don't you borrow them for me?
3;5;2021-04-28 06:27:00.480205;I don't know about that.
3;6;2021-04-28 06:27:17.480205;What if you lose the books?
3;4;2021-04-28 06:27:50.480205;I won't.I swear on my life.
3;3;2021-04-28 06:28:58.480205;Wow,you're so serious.
3;5;2021-04-28 06:29:22.480205;This is a great book you're checking out.
3;6;2021-04-28 06:30:32.480205;You have read it?
3;3;2021-04-28 06:31:34.480205;Read it?I memorized it!It is one of my favorites.
3;3;2021-04-28 06:32:20.480205;can I check out more than one?
3;4;2021-04-28 06:32:39.480205;Of course!It would be crazy if you could only get one book.
3;5;2021-04-28 06:33:03.480205;That is awesome!I'll be back.
3;6;2021-04-28 06:34:09.480205;Don't go crazy now.The limit is 15 books.
3;6;2021-04-28 06:34:59.480205;Don't worry.I'll probably come back with 5 more books.
3;4;2021-04-28 06:36:40.480205;It is great to see a kid excited about reading.
3;6;2021-04-28 06:38:35.480205;Would you like to check it out?
3;4;2021-04-28 06:39:51.480205;Yes,I'd like to check it out.
3;6;2021-04-28 06:41:35.480205;Interesting magazine choice,Reading about celebrities is not really smart of you.
3;5;2021-04-28 06:42:59.480205;Don't judge me,I can't read educational stuff all the time.
3;6;2021-04-28 06:43:22.480205;I do!I read Time and National Geographic.
3;4;2021-04-28 06:44:16.480205;Everyone is taste is different.
3;3;2021-04-28 06:45:23.480205;How long do you want to check that video out for?
3;4;2021-04-28 06:46:14.480205;One week would be nice.
3;6;2021-04-28 06:46:58.480205;That will be $5.
3;5;2021-04-28 06:48:03.480205;What?!I thought I could check out videos for free.
3;4;2021-04-28 06:48:58.480205;You can check out educational videos for free.
3;6;2021-04-28 06:49:08.480205;This is bogus.
3;5;2021-04-28 06:50:41.480205;It is still not a bad price.
3;4;2021-04-28 06:52:35.480205;Okay,what if I only borrow it for a day?
3;5;2021-04-28 06:53:49.480205;It will be $2.
3;6;2021-04-28 06:54:38.480205;Okay,here is $2.
3;4;2021-04-28 06:56:13.480205;So much for a library that services the public.
3;5;2021-04-28 06:57:14.480205;I hope you enjoy the movie.
3;4;2021-04-28 06:58:06.480205;For 2 bucks,I'd better love the movie
3;3;2021-04-28 06:58:16.480205;There is a huge rip here.
3;5;2021-04-28 07:00:00.480205;Did you put the tape there?
3;3;2021-04-28 07:00:35.480205;No,it was there before.
3;5;2021-04-28 07:01:31.480205;I know you're lying to me.
3;6;2021-04-28 07:02:15.480205;If you know,then why did you ask if I put the tape on?
3;6;2021-04-28 07:03:44.480205;I wanted to see if you were a liar or not.
3;5;2021-04-28 07:04:34.480205;How did you know I'm lying?
3;3;2021-04-28 07:05:25.480205;Before you check out the book,the librarian checks it for damage.
3;4;2021-04-28 07:06:42.480205;Wow,you guys think of everything.
3;3;2021-04-28 07:07:40.480205;Are you kidding me?
3;6;2021-04-28 07:09:35.480205;No,I am not kidding you.
3;5;2021-04-28 07:11:05.480205;Are you looking for something?
3;5;2021-04-28 07:13:00.480205;I'm researching for my project.
3;5;2021-04-28 07:13:10.480205;Can you come back tomorrow?Your daily computer limit time is up.
3;6;2021-04-28 07:13:30.480205;I don't have a computer at home.
3;6;2021-04-28 07:14:38.480205;My project is due very soon.I need to research.
3;3;2021-04-28 07:15:00.480205;How about books?This is a library after all.
3;3;2021-04-28 07:16:16.480205;I'll help you.
3;5;2021-04-28 07:16:36.480205;Thank you.I appreciate it
3;5;2021-04-28 07:18:14.480205;How much do I need to insert here to make one copy?
3;6;2021-04-28 07:19:23.480205;It depends.
3;3;2021-04-28 07:19:57.480205;Do you want your copy in color or black and white?
3;4;2021-04-28 07:21:38.480205;I want it in color.
3;6;2021-04-28 07:23:26.480205;Then it will be 20 cents per page.
3;5;2021-04-28 07:25:14.480205;That is kind of expensive.
3;5;2021-04-28 07:25:26.480205;Yeah,but most of us don't have a copy machine of our own.
3;5;2021-04-28 07:26:25.480205;I have one, but it is broken.
3;3;2021-04-28 07:28:15.480205;Do you really not have 20 cents?
3;5;2021-04-28 07:29:12.480205;I do,but I'm really cheap.
3;6;2021-04-28 07:30:06.480205;Well,you don't really have a choice at this point
3;5;2021-04-28 07:31:04.480205;Why is the printer line so long?
3;6;2021-04-28 07:32:46.480205;What do you have to print?
3;4;2021-04-28 07:33:36.480205;I have to print some notes.
3;4;2021-04-28 07:34:49.480205;Good luck,You'll be waiting here for a long time.
3;6;2021-04-28 07:36:05.480205;I bet the ink and paper will go out.
3;5;2021-04-28 07:36:53.480205;Do you have a restroom?
3;3;2021-04-28 07:37:45.480205;Only for employees.
3;5;2021-04-28 07:39:11.480205;But I really need to go.
3;6;2021-04-28 07:39:36.480205;I can't let you go.There is a restroom in the market across from us though.
3;5;2021-04-28 07:40:55.480205;That restroom is really dirty.It smells like someone died in there.
3;6;2021-04-28 07:41:46.480205;Fine,I'll take you to our restroom.
3;4;2021-04-28 07:42:29.480205;Yay!Thank you so much.
3;3;2021-04-28 07:44:01.480205;We have to go secretly.If anyone sees you use the restroom,I'll be fired.
3;6;2021-04-28 07:45:55.480205;Don't worry.I will be small and quiet as a mouse.
3;4;2021-04-28 07:46:11.480205;Okay,good.The password is 595.Go quickly before anyone sees you.
3;3;2021-04-28 07:46:35.480205;Thank you for your kindness.
3;3;2021-04-28 07:47:54.480205;You owe me if we ever see each other again.
3;5;2021-04-28 07:49:10.480205;What is so good about volunteering there?
3;4;2021-04-28 07:50:52.480205;It is fun,and you feel good about yourself.
3;3;2021-04-28 07:52:51.480205;What do you do there?
3;3;2021-04-28 07:54:42.480205;Everyone does different things,I organize events.
3;4;2021-04-28 07:55:37.480205;What kind of events?
3;6;2021-04-28 07:56:10.480205;Movies,art and crafts,magic shows and more.
3;6;2021-04-28 07:56:21.480205;That does sound fun!
3;5;2021-04-28 07:57:43.480205;Do you want to sign up?
3;6;2021-04-28 07:58:29.480205;Yeah,how do I sign up?
3;4;2021-04-28 08:00:26.480205;I'll get you an application.
3;4;2021-04-28 08:01:42.480205;I can't study at home,because my family talks so loudly.
3;5;2021-04-28 08:02:06.480205;Study at the library.
3;3;2021-04-28 08:03:27.480205;Can you focus in there?
3;6;2021-04-28 08:04:11.480205;Yes,it is always really quiet.
3;6;2021-04-28 08:04:42.480205;I'll go today.
3;6;2021-04-28 08:06:31.480205;Make sure you get a good seat.
3;6;2021-04-28 08:07:27.480205;Are there not enough seats for everyone?
3;4;2021-04-28 08:08:30.480205;It depends on when you go.
3;3;2021-04-28 08:09:16.480205;I'm going at 1:00 a.m.
3;6;2021-04-28 08:10:15.480205;Dude,it is not even open that late.
3;5;2021-04-28 08:12:07.480205;But that is the best time for me.
3;3;2021-04-28 08:12:42.480205;You can always try a cafe.They tend to close late or not at all.
3;6;2021-04-28 08:14:29.480205;What does that mean?
3;3;2021-04-28 08:16:17.480205;It means you can only read it in the library.
3;5;2021-04-28 08:16:53.480205;But I need it for my essay.
3;3;2021-04-28 08:17:12.480205;You can take pictures of the pages you need.
3;5;2021-04-28 08:18:09.480205;I need almost all of them.
3;6;2021-04-28 08:19:57.480205;You can keep coming back here.
3;6;2021-04-28 08:21:47.480205;That is so inconvenient.
3;4;2021-04-28 08:23:27.480205;It is,but they have to be kept here.
3;5;2021-04-28 08:25:11.480205;I guess I can take pictures of the pages then.
3;6;2021-04-28 08:26:54.480205;Sorry about the inconvenience.
3;6;2021-04-28 08:27:45.480205;It is okay,It is not your fault.
3;3;2021-04-28 08:29:22.480205;Ew!Look what I found in this book.
3;4;2021-04-28 08:30:36.480205;What is that?
3;5;2021-04-28 08:32:09.480205;It is a dead bug.
3;6;2021-04-28 08:32:22.480205;It is all squished and messy.
3;6;2021-04-28 08:34:12.480205;I can't read this book without being disgusted.
3;3;2021-04-28 08:35:39.480205;But don't you really want to check out this book?
3;5;2021-04-28 08:37:10.480205;I do,but I really can't.
3;6;2021-04-28 08:39:00.480205;I'll check it out then.
3;5;2021-04-28 08:39:21.480205;You can read it without being disgusted?
3;5;2021-04-28 08:39:33.480205;Yeah, I'll just skip that page.
3;5;2021-04-28 08:40:25.480205;There could be something really interesting on it.
3;5;2021-04-28 08:41:30.480205;Whatever!I'm just going to check out the book.
3;5;2021-04-28 08:43:06.480205;I'm applying to transfer out of this college.
3;6;2021-04-28 08:44:54.480205;I'm going to miss you. 
3;4;2021-04-28 08:45:57.480205;Me too.I'll text you every so often.
3;3;2021-04-28 08:46:24.480205;Why do you want to transfer?
3;6;2021-04-28 08:46:53.480205;I don't think here it is challenging enough for me.
3;5;2021-04-28 08:47:58.480205;You can join the honors program!
3;4;2021-04-28 08:49:47.480205;I did,and it wasn't challenging either.
3;5;2021-04-28 08:50:15.480205;Alright then,When are you going to start applying?
3;4;2021-04-28 08:51:36.480205;Next month.I'm already looking at the essay prompts.
3;6;2021-04-28 08:51:52.480205;Are they challenging?
3;6;2021-04-28 08:52:56.480205;Yes,but they're kind of fun!
3;6;2021-04-28 08:53:11.480205;I hope you get into wherever you want to go.
3;5;2021-04-28 08:53:22.480205;I don't know what university to transfer to.
3;4;2021-04-28 08:55:06.480205;There is a lot,so it is all about picking what suits your needs.
3;4;2021-04-28 08:56:33.480205;For starters,I would like a university in a safe area.
3;6;2021-04-28 08:58:26.480205;Okay,what else are you thinking about?
3;3;2021-04-28 08:59:34.480205;I want to live close to home.
3;5;2021-04-28 08:59:51.480205;I think UC Irvine would be good.
3;6;2021-04-28 09:00:43.480205;I don't think that is good for my major.
3;5;2021-04-28 09:02:00.480205;What is your major?
3;5;2021-04-28 09:03:42.480205;I'm majoring in philosophy.
3;3;2021-04-28 09:03:53.480205;Yeah,you're right.UCI is not good for philosophy.
3;4;2021-04-28 09:05:37.480205;I also want to go to a college that will increase my job opportunities.
3;4;2021-04-28 09:06:38.480205;What classes should I take to transfer?
3;6;2021-04-28 09:08:07.480205;You need a little bit of everything.
3;6;2021-04-28 09:09:15.480205;What do you mean?
3;6;2021-04-28 09:10:03.480205;You need to take at least one class in every subject.
3;5;2021-04-28 09:10:33.480205;Do I need to take a math class?
3;3;2021-04-28 09:11:05.480205;Even if your major is Portuguese,you have to take a math class.
3;6;2021-04-28 09:12:37.480205;That is so stupid.
3;6;2021-04-28 09:13:19.480205;It is just to make you more knowledgeable.
3;6;2021-04-28 09:14:24.480205;But I don't even need it!
3;4;2021-04-28 09:15:39.480205;It is been like this for ages.
3;5;2021-04-28 09:16:31.480205;Well,the policy should be changed.
3;3;2021-04-28 09:16:44.480205;It won't.So in the meantime,you should register for a math class.
3;5;2021-04-28 09:17:53.480205;Why are you taking this class?
3;4;2021-04-28 09:18:58.480205;I need it to transfer knowledge to others.
3;5;2021-04-28 09:20:44.480205;Me too!I would never take Speech 101 if I didn't need it.
3;5;2021-04-28 09:21:35.480205;Yeah,I hate public speaking.
3;4;2021-04-28 09:22:07.480205;Me too!I get so nervous.
3;3;2021-04-28 09:23:42.480205;I just want this class to be over with.
3;3;2021-04-28 09:25:33.480205;It is going to be a long semester.
3;3;2021-04-28 09:25:47.480205;Maybe after this class,we'll love public speaking.
3;4;2021-04-28 09:27:43.480205;I doubt it!
3;4;2021-04-28 09:29:42.480205;I don't even know why we have to take this class to transfer.
3;5;2021-04-28 09:30:46.480205;I guess it is to make us better speakers.
3;6;2021-04-28 09:31:50.480205;It'll all be worth it when we transfer.
3;3;2021-04-28 09:33:07.480205;You only need three more classes and you'll be ready to transfer
3;6;2021-04-28 09:34:22.480205;yes, you are correct.
3;4;2021-04-28 09:35:38.480205;Which classes do I need?
3;4;2021-04-28 09:36:50.480205;You need a history class,a physical science class,foreign language class.
3;3;2021-04-28 09:38:13.480205;Which history class should I take?
3;3;2021-04-28 09:39:55.480205;The one you're most interested in.
3;5;2021-04-28 09:41:04.480205;What are you doing?
3;3;2021-04-28 09:42:05.480205;I'm filling out my college application.
3;4;2021-04-28 09:43:59.480205;Do you need any help? 
3;3;2021-04-28 09:44:58.480205;Yes,I do need help.
3;5;2021-04-28 09:45:44.480205;Should I put my ethnicity?
3;6;2021-04-28 09:47:17.480205;It won't be used for or against you.It is really up to you.
3;3;2021-04-28 09:49:11.480205;should I put all of my extracurriculars?
3;4;2021-04-28 09:51:07.480205;Put the ones that you were heavily involved in.
3;3;2021-04-28 09:53:03.480205;should I put anything in the "additional information" section?
3;5;2021-04-28 09:54:05.480205;If you feel like you need to say something that you didn't mention before,then yes.
3;3;2021-04-28 09:55:45.480205;Can I say I got an A when I really just got a B? 
3;3;2021-04-28 09:56:39.480205;What Of course not!They will ask for your transcript.
3;4;2021-04-28 09:57:14.480205;How many universities are you applying to?
3;6;2021-04-28 09:58:55.480205;I'm applying to 12 universities.
3;4;2021-04-28 09:59:33.480205;Wow!That is a lot!
3;5;2021-04-28 10:00:19.480205;I just want a lot of options.
3;4;2021-04-28 10:00:32.480205;But it costs a lot of money and time!
3;6;2021-04-28 10:02:12.480205;I get fee waivers.
3;6;2021-04-28 10:02:59.480205;But how about the time?I mean, applying is a lot of work.
3;6;2021-04-28 10:03:52.480205;College applications ask similar questions.
3;4;2021-04-28 10:04:14.480205;Which ones are you applying to?
3;6;2021-04-28 10:04:39.480205;CSULA,UC Irvine,Yale.
3;5;2021-04-28 10:05:36.480205;Why?They're going to find out.
3;5;2021-04-28 10:06:52.480205;No,they're not!They're not going to check.
3;3;2021-04-28 10:08:11.480205;What does that mean?
3;5;2021-04-28 10:08:56.480205;The UCs will randomly select 10% of their applicants to provide proof of their extracurriculars.
3;4;2021-04-28 10:09:35.480205;You may be chosen,Be careful. 
3;6;2021-04-28 10:11:15.480205;You're right.
3;4;2021-04-28 10:11:47.480205;But there is only one space left.
3;6;2021-04-28 10:13:41.480205;That is terrible
3;4;2021-04-28 10:14:32.480205;Beg the professor?
3;5;2021-04-28 10:15:51.480205;If I have to.
3;4;2021-04-28 10:16:11.480205;You should cry!That might work.
3;3;2021-04-28 10:17:19.480205;I'm planning to,I can cry on demand.
3;6;2021-04-28 10:17:49.480205;Maybe you should take a theater class instead.
3;4;2021-04-28 10:19:03.480205;I desperately need to take an English class this semester.
3;6;2021-04-28 10:20:01.480205;So does everyone else.
3;5;2021-04-28 10:21:47.480205;It is the only class I need before I transfer.
3;3;2021-04-28 10:22:55.480205;Maybe you can pay someone for their spot. 
3;4;2021-04-28 10:24:03.480205;I honestly would do that if someone was willing to give up their spot.
3;4;2021-04-28 10:25:45.480205;What happens if you can't get the class?
3;5;2021-04-28 10:26:39.480205;Then I need to stay at Pasadena City College longer.
3;6;2021-04-28 10:27:38.480205;That would stink.
3;3;2021-04-28 10:28:02.480205;I know,that is why I need that class.
3;3;2021-04-28 10:28:31.480205;You can try taking it at another college.
3;4;2021-04-28 10:30:06.480205;I might do that.The closest community college is a two-hour drive.
3;6;2021-04-28 10:30:55.480205;I'm praying you get the English class.
3;4;2021-04-28 10:32:00.480205;I want to transfer,but I don't know where to start.
3;5;2021-04-28 10:32:50.480205;What do you want to major in?
3;3;2021-04-28 10:33:51.480205;I want to major in biology.
3;4;2021-04-28 10:35:16.480205;What are those requirements exactly?
3;5;2021-04-28 10:37:14.480205;I'll give you a sheet listing all of them.
3;3;2021-04-28 10:38:36.480205;What else do I have to do?
3;6;2021-04-28 10:39:31.480205;You should fulfill some,if not all,of your major requirements.
3;3;2021-04-28 10:39:56.480205;Okay,about when will I finish?
3;6;2021-04-28 10:41:21.480205;It really depends on how many classes you take and complete per semester.
3;4;2021-04-28 10:41:53.480205;What kind of favor?
3;4;2021-04-28 10:42:52.480205;Can you write a recommendation letter for me?
3;4;2021-04-28 10:43:53.480205;Why not?I was a good student.
3;3;2021-04-28 10:44:46.480205;Yes,you are a good student.
3;4;2021-04-28 10:46:13.480205;You read his recommendation letter?
3;4;2021-04-28 10:47:04.480205;Yeah.I couldn't resist.
3;6;2021-04-28 10:48:17.480205;What did he write?
3;6;2021-04-28 10:49:23.480205;Just that I'm a diligent student who does well.
3;6;2021-04-28 10:50:58.480205;When do you need another recommendation letter by?
3;5;2021-04-28 10:52:29.480205;I need one by this Friday.
3;3;2021-04-28 10:53:54.480205;What is that?
3;6;2021-04-28 10:55:30.480205;It is where a professional will give you tips and revise your personal statement.
3;6;2021-04-28 10:56:40.480205;That sounds helpful.
3;6;2021-04-28 10:58:05.480205;Yes,you are absolutely correct.
3;5;2021-04-28 10:59:24.480205;How was it?
3;6;2021-04-28 10:59:55.480205;The person leading the workshop was an English professor,so it was informative.
3;5;2021-04-28 11:00:39.480205;I'm kind of embarrassed to show my personal statement,though.
3;6;2021-04-28 11:02:08.480205;You shouldn't be.
3;5;2021-04-28 11:03:38.480205;What is wrong,why are you looking sad?
3;4;2021-04-28 11:05:34.480205;I was rejected from my dream school.
3;3;2021-04-28 11:06:11.480205;why would you want to go to a school that doesn't fit you?
3;4;2021-04-28 11:07:32.480205;When you say it like that,I understand you.
3;5;2021-04-28 11:07:59.480205;Yeah!Just focus on the schools that do want you.
3;3;2021-04-28 11:08:48.480205;You're right!Yale made a mistake rejecting me.
3;5;2021-04-28 11:09:32.480205;I have decided not to transfer.
3;5;2021-04-28 11:10:54.480205;Why not?You kept saying you wanted to.
3;3;2021-04-28 11:12:30.480205;I got accepted to all of the schools I applied to.
3;4;2021-04-28 11:14:24.480205;Congrats!You totally deserve it.
3;4;2021-04-28 11:15:50.480205;How many schools did you apply to?
3;4;2021-04-28 11:16:51.480205;I applied to six.
3;4;2021-04-28 11:18:29.480205;Is this your first time here?
3;6;2021-04-28 11:18:43.480205;It is my first day at this school.
3;5;2021-04-28 11:19:55.480205;Did you move in yet?
3;4;2021-04-28 11:21:30.480205;Yes,I have an apartment nearby.
3;6;2021-04-28 11:23:15.480205;What is your first class?
3;4;2021-04-28 11:24:11.480205;My very first class is human biology.
